# Revised GRE_Arugement 终极提纲beta
#### author: waventropy
## 说明：
题目序号参照ETS网站顺序，网址为：<http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool>，访问时间是2012.7.9,20:22。
参考了来自老G的《GRE  Argument终极提纲》以及《新GRE写作5.5》，《新老GRE题号对比argument》，一并致谢。有的地方注明了中文，考试的时候可以直接使用首字母代替。
文章采用Markdown语法，利用ReText2.1.6和chrome中MADE MARKDOWN EDITOR插件的在Ubuntu12.04LTS和Windows XP平台下写成。

利用《新GRE写作5.5》中的分类方法进行了题库归类，归类的原则为：题干相同或者相似的题目归类在一起，这样Argument的174道题目中，133道可以归类为44组，再加上总共有41道无法归类的题目，所以压缩后的分类为85类。每一类，都有相同或相似的提干，比如No.3和No.171都是关于是否要取消滑板的问题，问题的direction是一样，但是题干的角度完全不同。同样的事情从不同的角度提问，请体会具体的区别，或者用工具高亮出不同的表述带来的不同.个人感觉，ETS在相近的提干表达中就自动表述出不同题目的具体的逻辑漏洞区别，请仔细比较第5，159，173这三题关于accidents number的定语，从没有细说，到annual，到summertime都有表述，ETS就是在细节上体现区别。

建议准备的时候务必安排好针对questions，assumptions和evidence不同角度的自我模板。这样可以方便的写出自己的文章。同时对照OG和以前的范文修改。范文是唯一ETS认证的东西。

## 1
Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.

论据:

1. The Brim River is deep and broad
2. the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat
3. no Palean boats have been found


提纲：

* Need evidence to show that in Palean times, the Brim River should be as deep and broad.

* Need evidence to prove that the Palean people have no ability to make boat and other means like canoe to across the Brim River in Palean times. Also should rule out the possiblity that the Lithos people have the ability to cross the river or using boats possessed by other culture.

* Need evidenve to prove that the possibility that the Paleans may arrived in Lithos through other means like trade, or the baskets were carried to the Lithos by flood.

The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal.

"A recent study of eighteen rhesus (恒河猴) monkeys provides clues as to the effects of birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone (激素) cortisol (皮质素) , which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring."

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

论点：The birth order can affect an individual's levels of stimulation

论据：

1. In stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone (激素) cortisol (皮质素) , which primes the body for increased activity levels
2. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence).
3. first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring.

提纲：

* The common characteristic of firstborn infant monkeys, Firstborn human and first-time mother monkey can be the reason accounts for the phenomanenon.They are both primates so when the urgent situation is coming, they will react with hgiher hormone cortisol. So it is instead of the birth order but they are all primates.
* Another explanation is the ability of producing hormone cortisol maybe related to ages. for those too young or too old is hard to produce hormone cortisol
* also this is only a case study and 18  rhesus monkeys maybe special and can't represent the whole  rhesus monkeys.
* Still if producing hormone cortisol is just a reaction to some extreme emotion like fear or anxiety and we cann't related it with birth order.

The following appeared as a letter to the editor from a Central Plaza store owner.

"Over the past two years, the number of shoppers in Central Plaza has been steadily decreasing while the popularity of skateboarding has increased dramatically. Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in the plaza. There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the plaza. Thus, we recommend that the city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. If skateboarding is prohibited here, we predict that business in Central Plaza will return to its previously high levels."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：

* the city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza.

* Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in the plaza. 
* There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the plaza.

提纲：

* Q1: we should make sure it is the presence of skateboarders that results in the current situation of the plaza.  Maybe there are other reasons like the depressionn of economic and the decrease of population.
* Q2: is the presence of skateboarders that results a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism？ maybe it is the lack of managements and the fall of social secruity.
* Q3：The survey was based only on data from Central Plaza store owners, thus could not be representative of all citizens. 
* Q4: is there other possible means to regain the plaza’s prosperity?

The following appeared as a letter to the editor from the owner of a skate shop in Central Plaza.

"Two years ago the city voted to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. They claimed that skateboard users were responsible for the litter and vandalism that were keeping other visitors from coming to the plaza. In the past two years, however, there has only been a small increase in the number of visitors to Central Plaza, and litter and vandalism are still problematic. Skateboarding is permitted in Monroe Park, however, and there is no problem with litter or vandalism there. In order to restore Central Plaza to its former glory, then, we recommend that the city lift its prohibition on skateboarding in the plaza."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation

* Skateboarding is permitted in Monroe Park, however, and there is no problem with litter or vandalism there.

提纲：

* Q1:The survey of there has only been a small increase in the number of visitors to Central Plaza, and litter and vandalism are still problematic should be better reviewed and as the owner of a a skate shop in Central Plaza, those claims is suspicious at least the third-party obseveration should be introduced to judge whether it is a small increase and problematic. Moreover all those vague statement should be specific.
* Q2: Is it useful to lift the prohibition. If all the statements to be true, we cann't say that the presence of skateboarders is related with the decrease of visitors and  litter and vandalism. Maybe other reasons are accounted like lack of managements.
* Q3: is there other possible means to regain the plaza’s prosperity? Maybe it is the influence of depression and the low low products quality of shops in Central Plaza.

The following appeared in a letter from a homeowner to a friend.

"Of the two leading real estate firms in our town—Adams Realty and Fitch Realty—Adams Realty is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time. Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams Realty."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：Adams Realty can sell homes quickly and at good price, therefore clearly superior to Fitch Realty.

论据：

* Adams has 40 real estate agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time.
* Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000.
* Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month.

提纲:

* Assumption1:the quality of a real estate firm is directly proportional to the number of its agents or the number of hours per week that its agents work. 
* Assumption2: the higher revenue represents the higher profit and the average revenue means the whole situation of the company. To be specific, the unstated assumption is that the two can be compared in thieir business such as the same market positioning.
* Assumption3: all the situation is the same after 10 years has passed. Still the unstated assumption is the slow selling process of Fitch Realty is their own fault for example it maybe due to the depression of economy.

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island Gazette.

"On Balmer Island, where mopeds serve as a popular form of transportation, the population increases to 100,000 during the summer months. To reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians, the town council of Balmer Island should limit the number of mopeds rented by the island's moped rental companies from 50 per day to 25 per day during the summer season. By limiting the number of rentals, the town council will attain the 50 percent annual reduction in moped accidents that was achieved last year on the neighboring island of Seaville, when Seaville's town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：

* To reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians, the town council of Balmer Island should limit the number of mopeds rented by the island's moped rental companies from 50 per day to 25 per day during the summer season.
* By limiting the number of rentals, the town council will attain the 50 percent annual reduction in moped accidents

提纲：

* Q1: Balmer Island may not be comparable to the neighboring island of Seaville such as population density, traffic facilities, roads situation, traffic control, local observation of traffic law. The author assumes that all other conditions in Balmer that might affect the rate of moped-pedestrian accidents will remain unchanged after the restrictions are enacted. 
* Q2: fails to consider other possible explanations for the 50% decline in the neighboring island of Seaville's moped accident rate last year and provide no exact data about the similar limits on moped rentals.
* Q3: Is the number of mopeds the only thing accounts for the the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians. For example, there are a rapid increase of population  or the  traffice sign system is too bad, or the climate of summer in Balmer Island is hard for mopeds.
* Q4: Is the limit of rental companies in summer useful the 50 percent annual reduction in moped accidents ? for example, people have their own mopeds or the number of moped accidents in summer is only a small part of the annual accidents.
* Q5： forget if the traffic system now can accept the increasing demand of people who uses mopeds now and whether along with the reduction of mopeds there will be more pressure in traffic even cause more accients.

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island Gazette.

"The population on Balmer Island increases to 100,000 during the summer months. To reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians, the town council of Balmer Island plans to limit the number of mopeds rented by each of the island's six moped rental companies from 50 per day to 30 per day during the summer season. Last year, the neighboring island of Torseau enforced similar limits on moped rentals and saw a 50 percent reduction in moped accidents. We predict that putting these limits into effect on Balmer Island will result in the same reduction in moped accidents."

.The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island Gazette.

"The population on Balmer Island doubles during the summer months. During the summer, then, the town council of Balmer Island should decrease the maximum number of moped rentals allowed at each of the island's six moped and bicycle rental companies from 50 per day to 30 per day. This will significantly reduce the number of summertime accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians. The neighboring island of Torseau actually saw a 50 percent reduction in moped accidents last year when Torseau's town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals. To help reduce moped accidents, therefore, we should also enforce these limitations during the summer months."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* Assumption3:The only cause of accidents is the number of mopeds and other conditions  like the number of population and the traffic situation. 
* Assumption4:The accidents happened in summer is the majority of the accidents numbers only by this meanings can the limits in summertime can be effective.（这是针对论点来说的，虽然论据中表明his will significantly reduce the number of summertime accidents）
* Assumption5: accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians 和 moped accidents is the same

Arctic deer live on islands in Canada's arctic regions. They search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of the year. Their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough, at least some of the year, for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands, allowing the deer to travel over it. Unfortunately, according to reports from local hunters, the deer populations are declining. Since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt, we can conclude that the purported decline in deer populations is the result of the deer's being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：the purported decline in deer populations is the result of the deer's being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea due to global warming.

* these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt.

提纲：

* evidence1：The accuracy of the reports from local hunters can not be cast doubt on. (selective sample) 
* evidence2: the decrease of Arctic deer is beyond the normal margin and it is not only a short-term phenomenon
* evidence3: The global warming trends may have no effects on the specific region mentioned by the editorial. Although the two happens together we can not conclude that global warming is the reason. So the author needs to careful study the route of Arctic deer to get the answer what changes of these ice layer.
* evidence4: The author should make us convienced that deer can not adapt themselves to the new weather by certain means like finding new food sources or change their  age-old migration patterns.
* evidence5: Alternative explanations can also account for the decline in arctic deer population like new dead virus or air polluation or the disaperance of habitat.

The following is a recommendation from the Board of Directors of Monarch Books.

"We recommend that Monarch Books open a café in its store. Monarch, having been in business at the same location for more than twenty years, has a large customer base because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects. Clearly, opening the café would attract more customers. Space could be made for the café by discontinuing the children's book section, which will probably become less popular given that the most recent national census indicated a significant decline in the percentage of the population under age ten. Opening a café will allow Monarch to attract more customers and better compete with Regal Books, which recently opened its own café."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：To attract more customers, Monarch Books should open a café in its store.
 
论据：

* Monarch, having been in business at the same location for more than twenty years, has a large customer base because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects.
* Space could be made for the café by discontinuing the children's book section, which will probably become less popular given that the most recent national census indicated a significant decline in the percentage of the population under age ten.
* Opening a café will allow Monarch to attract more customers and better compete with Regal Books, which recently opened its own café."

提纲：

* Q1:Are the two bookstores comparable at every aspect? Maybe Regal Books uses café store to compensate the low income of their book selling, in this case,  Monarch can ignore the opening of a new book store. Still we can question the effectiveness in attracting csutomers?
* Q2: Is it appropriate to use children's book section for the café just for a suvery indicates that a significant decline in the percentage of the population under age ten? A decline in the percentage of the population under age ten doesn't mean the whole unmber of children under age 10 is decreasing. Maybe it is due to the qucik increse of population of adult like immigrant. Further more, even the smaller population under 10 doesn't mean the less profit from children books. The fewer number of children may get more support from their parents and spend more money on children books. Still the if the book price rises, we can not safely say the profit of books will decrease. 
* Q3: Use children books as café may hurt  Monarch Books' reputation of wide selection of books on all subjects.
* Q4: Although Monarch, having been in business at the same location for more than twenty years, this doesn't ensure that it has a large customer base. Furthermore if it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects, we can not ensure that opening of a café can still keep its unique characteristic. The noise and smell of café may ruin the atomsphere of Monarch.

The following is a recommendation from the business manager of Monarch Books.

"Since its opening in Collegeville twenty years ago, Monarch Books has developed a large customer base due to its reader-friendly atmosphere and wide selection of books on all subjects. Last month, Book and Bean, a combination bookstore and coffee shop, announced its intention to open a Collegeville store. Monarch Books should open its own in-store café in the space currently devoted to children's books. Given recent national census data indicating a significant decline in the percentage of the population under age ten, sales of children's books are likely to decline. By replacing its children's books section with a café, Monarch Books can increase profits and ward off competition from Book and Bean."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* By replacing its children's books section with a café, Monarch Books can increase profits and ward off competition from Book and Bean.

提纲：

* Assumption1: Book and Bean can successfully open its new store in Collegeville if not we can doubt the neccessity of change.
* Assumption2: if Monarch Books doesn't open café, it will lose its competion against Book and Bean. 
* Assumption3: a significant decline in the percentage of the population under age ten will result in the decrease of number of teenages under 10.
* Assumption4: the decrease of children will result in the decrease of children book need.
* Assumption5: Still he should assume that the price of children books doesn't rise.
* Assumption6: Opening its own in-store café in the space currently devoted to children's books, will not hurt its reputation of wide selection of books on all subjects.
* Assumption7: Still this new in-store café will not disturb the reader-friendly atmosphere of  Monarch Books.

The following appeared in a memo from the director of student housing at Buckingham College.

"To serve the housing needs of our students, Buckingham College should build a number of new dormitories. Buckingham's enrollment is growing and, based on current trends, will double over the next 50 years, thus making existing dormitory space inadequate. Moreover, the average rent for an apartment in our town has risen in recent years. Consequently, students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus housing. Finally, attractive new dormitories would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：Buckingham College should build a number of new dormitories to serve the housing needs of our students.

论据：

* Buckingham's enrollment is growing and, based on current trends, will double over the next 50 years, thus making existing dormitory space inadequate. 
* the average rent for an apartment in our town has risen in recent years. Consequently, students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus housing.
* attractive new dormitories would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham.

提纲：


* Evidence1: the trends of increasing enrollment will continue in the future. He will need to proivde the data of other universities or the enrollement number of Buckingham last few years. In deed, the enrollment number will double over the next 50 years is really a very small grow every year. In contrast, we can get the number doubled over 5 years if the year growth rate is 9 percent. (the exact growth rate every year is 0.01395948 if you consider one year two enrollment it will be 0.00695555) So we need more evidence to judge whether it is a large growth and better illustrate that current dormitories in Buckingham could not meet students’ housing needs
* Evidence2: we should prove that the rent for off-campus apartment will continue to increase in the following years.  Moreover, the average rent for an apartment in our town has risen doesn't mean all the rent for apartment will rise. For university students, the rise of rent in top level will not affect their lives.
* Evidence3: The author should prove that the rise of the house rent  is a long-term phonomenon and we can pridcit the long time trend of rent.
* Evidence4: We should rule out the possiblity that along with the rise of the rent the economic situation of students will also be risen. In this case, giving aid to those students from poor family will be more effective.
* Evidence5: A new dormitory would be both sufficient nor necessary for attracting prospective students.

Nature's Way, a chain of stores selling health food and other health-related products, is opening its next franchise in the town of Plainsville. The store should prove to be very successful: Nature's Way franchises tend to be most profitable in areas where residents lead healthy lives, and clearly Plainsville is such an area. Plainsville merchants report that sales of running shoes and exercise clothing are at all-time highs. The local health club has more members than ever, and the weight training and aerobics classes are always full. Finally, Plainsville's schoolchildren represent a new generation of potential customers: these schoolchildren are required to participate in a fitness-for-life program, which emphasizes the benefits of regular exercise at an early age.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia. Using an observation-centered approach to studying Tertian culture, he concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents. Recently another anthropologist, Dr. Karp, visited the group of islands that includes Tertia and used the interview-centered method to study child-rearing practices. In the interviews that Dr. Karp conducted with children living in this group of islands, the children spent much more time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village. Dr. Karp decided that Dr. Field's conclusion about Tertian village culture must be invalid. Some anthropologists recommend that to obtain accurate information on Tertian child-rearing practices, future research on the subject should be conducted via the interview-centered method.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：Future research on the subject should be conducted via the interview-centered method according to the infromation of child-rearing practices in the island of Tertia.

提纲：
* Q1: Talking more about their biological parents does not indicate that those children were reared by their parents. 
* Q2: There may have been dramatic changes in Teria children during the past 20 years.
* Q3: Dr. Field only visited the island of Tertia but Dr. Karp visited the group of islands that includes Tertia , this may influence the accuracy of the judgement.
* Q4: No evidence could guarantee that Dr. Karp’s team will establish a more accurate understanding of island cultures just because they are using the interview-centered method. For example, how the interview questions are designed, are they biased, or the  participators are not carefully answered the questions.
* Q5: Even if  Dr. Karp is a noted anthropologist, we can not only rely  on his research to decide whether the new project's direction. We should introduce independant third-party's judgement.
* Q6: Is interview-centered method  the only best method for this research?  Can immsersion method be effective?

The following appeared in an article written by Dr. Karp, an anthropologist.

"Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia and concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents. However, my recent interviews with children living in the group of islands that includes Tertia show that these children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village. This research of mine proves that Dr. Field's conclusion about Tertian village culture is invalid and thus that the observation-centered approach to studying cultures is invalid as well.

The council of Maple County, concerned about the county's becoming overdeveloped, is debating a proposed measure that would prevent the development of existing farmland in the county. But the council is also concerned that such a restriction, by limiting the supply of new housing, could lead to significant increases in the price of housing in the county. Proponents of the measure note that Chestnut County established a similar measure ten years ago, and its housing prices have increased only modestly since. However, opponents of the measure note that Pine County adopted restrictions on the development of new residential housing fifteen years ago, and its housing prices have since more than doubled. The council currently predicts that the proposed measure, if passed, will result in a significant increase in housing prices in Maple County.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

论点：The proposed measure, if passed, will result in a significant increase in housing prices in Maple County.

提纲：

* Q1:The author does not demonstrate that Maple County,Pine City and Chestnut City are comparable at every aspect. 几者都是列举论证的首要问题就是可比性的大小。 like marco-economic environment, supple and demand of realty business, land supply ,living condition, purchase power. What's more ten years and 15 years ago and present time of Maple county  are very different.
* Q2: Are Maple County,Pine City and Chestnut City limited the same kind of  realty business? For example, Maple County and Chestnut City are limiting the supply of new housing, but these houses can be residental house and commercial property but the Pine City adopted restrictions on the development of new residential housing, So whether it is kind of housen usage changed the effects of policy or the Maple County should better revise its policy. 
* Q3: The author fails to prove that the situation of Chestnut City will also take place in Maple City, or that Maple  will not follow  Chestnut County ’s pattern.
* Q4: the aim of  Maple County is to prevent the development of existing farmland and becoming overdeveloped, so is there another ways to realize this aim? Like promote new economy like Financial Industry， Information Industry and Education Industry.

Fifteen years ago, Omega University implemented a new procedure that encouraged students to evaluate the teaching effectiveness of all their professors. Since that time, Omega professors have begun to assign higher grades in their classes, and overall student grade averages at Omega have risen by 30 percent. Potential employers, looking at this dramatic rise in grades, believe that grades at Omega are inflated and do not accurately reflect student achievement; as a result, Omega graduates have not been as successful at getting jobs as have graduates from nearby Alpha University. To enable its graduates to secure better jobs, Omega University should terminate student evaluation of professors.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

提纲：

* Evidence1： The graduates from the two universities may not be comparable.  The two school may have many differences. like the major influence,  Alpha University may have many engineering specialityies but Omega University is famous as its literature and science study. 
* E2: Still we don't know whether  Alpha University adopt student evaluation of professors. If not, any difference between the two can be referred as the reason why the two universities has such  a big differences.
* E3: The advice fails to mention the positive effects of the evaluation system. for example: it will help the professor better change their teaching skills and makes the students invloved in the classroom more.
* E4: The view of  Potential employers should be better stated in more details like their opinion represents the whole opinion of  Potential employers.
* E5: The reasons makes Alpha University students get jobs easier like over-all employment tutoring and a more close to work course system.
* E6: There will be other possible ways by which Omega can increase its job-placement record.

In an attempt to improve highway safety, Prunty County last year lowered its speed limit from 55 to 45 miles per hour on all county highways. But this effort has failed: the number of accidents has not decreased, and, based on reports by the highway patrol, many drivers are exceeding the speed limit. Prunty County should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that Butler County completed five years ago: increasing lane widths, resurfacing rough highways, and improving visibility at dangerous intersections. Today, major Butler County roads still have a 55 mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in Butler County this past year than there were five years ago.

提纲：

* 两个现象说明，限速的失败：分别是事故数没有减少和许多司机依旧超速。但是我们还是需要其他证据来说明都是限速而不是其他原因引起的这些变化。同时巡警的报告是不是可信？
* The author fails to rule out the possibility that not enough time has passed to determine the effectiveness of this change in reducing the accident rate. The fact that most drivers are exceeding the new speed limit does not indicate that the policy is ineffective. Maybe it needs time for the drivers to adopt to the new speed limmitation.
* The argument assumes that all other factors affecting highway accident rates have remained unchanged since the county lowered its speed limit. for example the climate doesn't changed and the traffic sign is the same.
* The cited statistic involves only "reported" accidents in Butler County, we do not know the percentage of accidents which are going unreported in that county.  maybe the car number in Prunty County has greatly incresed recently.
* the author unfairly implies that the road improvement project  in Butler County has served to decrease the incidence of road accidents in that county. for example, maybe many prople in Butler County like to use public traffic system or whether Butler County sets too high tax stands for private cars.
* The situation at Prunty County and Butler County may not be comparable. The author fails to demonstrate that road improvement will be both sufficient and necessary to guarantee fewer accidents in Prunty County.

The following appeared as part of an article in a business magazine.

"A recent study rating 300 male and female Mentian advertising executives according to the average number of hours they sleep per night showed an association between the amount of sleep the executives need and the success of their firms. Of the advertising firms studied, those whose executives reported needing no more than 6 hours of sleep per night had higher profit margins and faster growth. These results suggest that if a business wants to prosper, it should hire only people who need less than 6 hours of sleep per night."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* 第三个假设是：没有其他原因导致了睡眠不足6小时的管理者所在的公司更加成功。比如：是不是这段时间，所在的广告行业普遍繁荣，是行业性的增长带来了成绩？或者是不是这些人所在的公司管理更加严格，工作量又很大，所以他们的睡眠较少，但是这也不是可以断定睡眠少有关系的。
* 第四个假设：这是推论但是也必须成立。即任何时候只要管理者减少睡眠，企业业绩必须增长，这个显然是不切合实际的。
* 第五个假设：要使结论成立，必须假设针对广告行业的调查可以推广到其他行业去，才会有if a business wants to prosper, it should hire only people who need less than 6 hours of sleep per night.

The following memorandum is from the business manager of Happy Pancake House restaurants.

"Recently, butter has been replaced by margarine in Happy Pancake House restaurants throughout the southwestern United States. This change, however, has had little impact on our customers. In fact, only about 2 percent of customers have complained, indicating that an average of 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. Furthermore, many servers have reported that a number of customers who ask for butter do not complain when they are given margarine instead. Clearly, either these customers do not distinguish butter from margarine or they use the term 'butter' to refer to either butter or margarine."

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

* Some customers might be unhappy but didn’t complain. so only about 2 percent of customers have complained, not indicating that an average of 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. 
* The author fails to indicate the actual number of servers who reported, and what percentage of the whole server group do they make up, thus we cannot evaluate if the fact cited above is significant. Also, the author does not tell us the percentage of customers who do not complain.
* The fact that few customers complain when they are given margarine might be explained by other factors, not necessarily by the explanations provided by the author. for example many people maybe just don't want to ruin the happy environment of lunch.
* The author fails to provide any information concerning the possible change in the profit of Happy Pancake House after the replacement, thus we cannot evaluate the overall effect of the recommendation mentioned above.

The following memorandum is from the business manager of Happy Pancake House restaurants.

"Butter has now been replaced by margarine in Happy Pancake House restaurants throughout the southwestern United States. Only about 2 percent of customers have complained, indicating that an average of 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. Furthermore, many servers have reported that a number of customers who ask for butter do not complain when they are given margarine instead. Clearly, either these customers cannot distinguish butter from margarine or they use the term 'butter' to refer to either butter or margarine. Thus, to avoid the expense of purchasing butter and to increase profitability, the Happy Pancake House should extend this cost-saving change to its restaurants in the southeast and northeast as well."

In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports (swimming, boating, and fishing) among their favorite recreational activities. The Mason River flowing through the city is rarely used for these pursuits, however, and the city park department devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside recreational facilities. For years there have been complaints from residents about the quality of the river's water and the river's smell. In response, the state has recently announced plans to clean up Mason River. Use of the river for water sports is, therefore, sure to increase. The city government should for that reason devote more money in this year's budget to riverside recreational facilities.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：

* Use of  Mason river for water sports is, therefore, sure to increase.
* The city government should for that reason devote more money in this year's budget to riverside recreational facilities.

论据：

* For years there have been complaints from residents about the quality of the river's water and the river's smell.
* In response, the state has recently announced plans to clean up Mason River. 


提纲：

* 调查问题永远是值得考量的。要使得调查成立有如下许多假设：参与调查的居民有普遍的代表性，可以代表绝大多数的居民的意见的；参与的居民有如实地回答居民的问题；调查的方案设计科学合理；调查实施机构中立，客观，无利益干扰。
* The author simply assumes that it is the quality of the water in Mason River that prevents residents from using it for recreational activities.是不是水质阻止使用Mason river。 
* The author fails to consider if Mason River is suitable for those water sports favored by residents in Mason, and if residents are willing to use the river for recreational activities. Mason river是不是适合水上运动，比如河水太急，这是运输河道。
*  Granted that recreational use of the river is to increase, we are not convinced that the use of the publicly owned lands along the river will also increase. 比如居民可以去其他的水上运动场馆，进行替代性的活动而不是水上运动。
*   No evidence could illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed plan, and how much time would it take for the plan to be effective, thus we cannot ensure that recreational use of the river will automatically increase. 首先州政府的计划必须可以如期实施；其次，河道清理计划可以解决水质问题而不是暂时性的缓解；这个过程中居民对水上运动的热情必须不消退。
*   The author does not provide evidence to illustrate the necessity of increasing budget for improvement s to the public lands. 首先，清理河道可以完成；而且可以吸引居民的注意力；没有其他投资渠道，比如私人投资，民间投资，公众捐款等。

The following appeared in a memorandum from the manager of WWAC radio station.

"To reverse a decline in listener numbers, our owners have decided that WWAC must change from its current rock-music format. The decline has occurred despite population growth in our listening area, but that growth has resulted mainly from people moving here after their retirement. We must make listeners of these new residents. We could switch to a music format tailored to their tastes, but a continuing decline in local sales of recorded music suggests limited interest in music. Instead we should change to a news and talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in our area."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：WWAC radio station should hange to a news and talk format.

论据：

* To reverse a decline in listener numbers, our owners have decided that WWAC must change from its current rock-music format. The decline has occurred despite population growth in our listening area, but that growth has resulted mainly from people moving here after their retirement.
* We could switch to a music format tailored to their tastes, but a continuing decline in local sales of recorded music suggests limited interest in music.
*  Instead we should change to a news and talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in our area.

提纲：

* 为了作出改变必须得到的evidence为： 到底是什么使得电台的听众人数下降。同时如果作者的论述正确，那么我们必须对于新搬迁来的人口进行调查才可以确认他们的喜好而不是武断地判定，他们的收听倾向。
* The arguer falsely assumes that older people do not prefer rock-and-roll but favor all-news program­ming.
* The sales of recorded music are not a good indication of whether people prefer rock-and-roll.
* We do not know what types of music recordings actually experienced sales decline in the music stores, thus cannot evaluate if the decline results from decreasing popularity of rock-and-roll.
* The manager fails to illustrate that people who buy music recordings are basically the same group of people who listen to music on the radio. (are the respondents representative?)
* The fact that citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics before the election does not necessarily imply that they will also be interested in continuous news program all the time. (When was the survey conducted?)
* Several other factors may also contribute to the decline in the number of listeners.  for example the listeners have gained the new source for the music like they can download mp3 from the Internet; or the ecomomny is under depression so people decrease their money spending on music.
* 同时作者说新闻和访谈节目收到这个地区听众的欢迎但是没有给出WWAC电台和其他电台是否据具有可比性？其他电台和WWAC是不是有极大的不同？一旦采用新的形式会不会赶走很多原有的观众？

The following appeared in a memorandum from the manager of WWAC radio station.

"WWAC must change from its current rock-music format because the number of listeners has been declining, even though the population in our listening area has been growing. The population growth has resulted mainly from people moving to our area after their retirement, and we must make listeners of these new residents. But they seem to have limited interest in music: several local stores selling recorded music have recently closed. Therefore, just changing to another kind of music is not going to increase our audience. Instead, we should adopt a news-and-talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in our area."

The following appeared in a memorandum from the general manager of KNOW radio station.

"Several factors indicate that radio station KNOW should shift its programming from rock-and-roll music to a continuous news format. Consider, for example, that the number of people in our listening area over fifty years of age has increased dramatically, while our total number of listeners has declined. Also, music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music. Finally, continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful. The switch from rock-and-roll music to 24-hour news will attract older listeners and secure KNOW radio's future."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

这题换了一个电台名称，叫做KNOW radio station。基本的主题和主要论点都没有太大的改变。

论点： KNOW radio station should switch from rock-and-roll music to 24-hour news to attract older listeners and secure KNOW radio's future.

论据：

* several factors indicate that radio station KNOW should shift its programming from rock-and-roll music to a continuous news format. Consider, for example, that the number of people in our listening area over fifty years of age has increased dramatically, while our total number of listeners has declined. 
* music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music. 
* continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful.

提纲：

* 假设一：听众人数下降是因为rock-and-roll music。这缺少证据。
* 假设二：50岁以上人口不喜欢rock-and-roll music导致了 the number of people in our listening area over fifty years of age has increased dramatically, while our total number of listeners has declined。 但是这不成立因为如果其他年龄段损失听众人数过多那么总人数还是会下降。同时，即使这些50岁以上人口喜欢rock-and-roll music也不代表他们必须听广播，比如他们可以去网上下载mp3。
* 假设三： 作者假设，人们如果喜欢音乐一定回去买recorded music，所以recorded music的下降代表了人们不喜欢这种音乐。但是人们喜欢音乐一定要去买唱片么？其实还有其他途径的到音乐比如下载，或者租用CD。
* 假设四： 这两个地方的情形可以类比。但是neighboring cities的成功不一定可以在 radio station KNOW复制。这两个城市的人口结构，听众趣味，运行模式都会影响最后的结构。
* 假设五：作者必须假设改版后，那些50岁以上的人口喜欢24-hour news同时以前那些喜欢摇滚音乐的人也会喜欢上24-hour news。这样电台的改版才会成功。

The following is a memorandum from the business manager of a television station.

"Over the past year, our late-night news program has devoted increased time to national news and less time to weather and local news. During this period, most of the complaints received from viewers were concerned with our station's coverage of weather and local news. In addition, local businesses that used to advertise during our late-night news program have canceled their advertising contracts with us. Therefore, in order to attract more viewers to our news programs and to avoid losing any further advertising revenues, we should expand our coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：we should expand our coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs to attract more viewers to our news programs and to avoid losing any further advertising revenues.

论据：

* Over the past year, our late-night news program has devoted increased time to national news and less time to weather and local news. During this period, most of the complaints received from viewers were concerned with our station's coverage of weather and local news. 
* In addition, local businesses that used to advertise during our late-night news program have canceled their advertising contracts with us.

提纲：

* 假设一：抱怨电话必须有足够的数量和观众代表性。The manager fails to provide the total number of complaints received before our coverage of news were changed. What's more The manager simply assumes that those complaints are representative of the opinions of our entire audience.
* 假设二： 大部分观众的电话都是关于天气预报减少的这一事实。因为，观众抱怨节目不一定代表是因为节目时间减少，也有可能是节目质量太差，报道不准确这些。The manager fails to inform us the details of the complaints we received, thus we cannot evaluate if these audience are dissatisfied with the quantity of weather and local news. In addition,The manager fails to analyze the actual attitude of our audience toward the late-night news program, the program might be welcome although there are a few complaints about it.
* 假设三：The manager unjustifiably assumes that it is the change in our coverage of news that caused those businesses to cancel their contract with us.第一，没有给出赞助商退订广告的具体数量，占所有赞助商赞助资金总额的比例。如果只是少数公司这种情况不足为虑。第二，即使是大范围减少，也可能是其他原因，比如经济滑坡，这些公司的资金周转出了问题；再者也不一定是减少天气预报时间带来的，可能是出现了新的广告渠道。
* 假设四： 必须假设所有的观众都会喜欢expand our coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs，否则如果观众不喜欢那么不会实现扩大收入的目的。比如对于喜欢全国新闻的客户怎么办？ The necessity of expanding the coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs is open to doubt.
* 假设五：The manager ignores many other possible methods to attract more viewers and to increase advertising revenues.

Two years ago, radio station WCQP in Rockville decided to increase the number of call-in advice programs that it broadcast; since that time, its share of the radio audience in the Rockville listening area has increased significantly. Given WCQP's recent success with call-in advice programming, and citing a nationwide survey indicating that many radio listeners are quite interested in such programs, the station manager of KICK in Medway recommends that KICK include more call-in advice programs in an attempt to gain a larger audience share in its listening area.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：KICK in Medway should include more call-in advice programs in an attempt to gain a larger audience share in its listening area.

论据：

* Two years ago, radio station WCQP in Rockville decided to increase the number of call-in advice programs that it broadcast; since that time, its share of the radio audience in the Rockville listening area has increased significantly.
* A nationwide survey indicating that many radio listeners are quite interested in such programs
* the station manager of KICK in Medway recommends that KICK include more call-in advice programs in an attempt to gain a larger audience share in its listening area.

提纲:

* Q1:对于论据1首先是不是因为 increase the number of call-in advice programs that it broadcast使得WCQP's share of the radio audience in the Rockville listening area has increased significantly是值得我们考虑的。是不是其他原因引起的？比如人口变化，老年人人口比例增加了，而他们更加喜欢广播？ 或者因为很多的WCQP的竞争对手推出广播电台，转向新的媒体比如电视，互联网导致了WCQP的听众增加。或者WCQP还加入了新的更有吸引力的节目？
* Q2： increased significantly是一个与增长幅度有有关的概念，我们必须知道原来的基数是多少才可以判断增加的人数。比如原来有1%的听众，到达3%就可以说是很大的增加。
* Q3： 全国性质的调查。调查第一怀疑独立性，权威性，代表性。则个调查是谁做的？其次，调查有一个很模糊的概念，many代表多少观众喜欢call-in advice programs？这些观众所占总体人数的比例是多少？这次观众的意见是不是代表总体观众的意见？最后，即使这些都成立全国性质的调查是不是可以在Medway完美代表，说不定Medway有自己独特的人口结构。
* Q4： the station manager of KICK in Medway的意见是否考虑到KICK和WCQP之间是不是有可以对比的地方。两地的观众兴趣，经济水平，人口结构，新闻报道习惯是否可以参照？同时Two years ago的政策是不是可以对比？有没有什么新的变化？

According to a recent report, cheating among college and university students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successfully reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced a system in which teachers closely monitored students; under that system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's in order to decrease cheating among students.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

*  Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.

提纲：

* Q1:是不是原来的制度老师抓作弊很严格，新的制度是不是学生之间有互相包庇，隐瞒不报的情况？The assumption that students will keep their promise under the existence of the codes is unwarranted. What's more, The author unfairly assumes that Groveton stu­dents are just as capable of detecting cheating as faculty monitors, and that these students are just as likely to report cheating whenever they observe it. In addition,The author fails to investigate the number of cases of cheating which were not reported.
* Q2：Other factors could also explain the decreasing number of cases of cheating at Groveton.比如五年后，入学的人数大大减少，同时这也代表着我们并不知道作弊在学生群体中的比例，或许虽然作弊总数下降但是作弊的比例却在上升。
* Q3： We do not know the situation of cheating in other years. 或许作弊的人数有反复，并不能据此作出长期趋势的判断。
* Q4：针对学生调查，永远值得怀疑。这是不是学生中的大多数？是不是可以代表总体学生的心声？同时有没有确保学生可以在自己的隐私得到保护的情况下做问卷调查，是不是有其他的老师在场呢？调查者的立场也值得考量，是不是公正，客观。
* Q5：推广到其他高校，但是这个类推是不是正确合理？如果其他高校作弊并不是很严重，甚至没有是不是必须采用这种措施？同时，其他高校学生作弊的原因是不是和Groveton一样？不一样的话，Groveton做法的效用就值得仔细考量。The honor code may not be as same effective at other colleges and universities as it was at Grovetown.
* Q6：The author fails to illustrate that the number of cases of cheating at Groveton would be higher if we did not adopt the honor code. 如果不采用这样的方法是不是作弊人数就会上升呢？如果随着社会教育的提高，可能学生整体素质在提高。
*  The author fails to consider the negative effects of adopting such honor codes and Other measures could be taken to combat cheating.

Evidence suggests that academic honor codes, which call for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated, are far more successful than are other methods at deterring cheating among students at colleges and universities. Several years ago, Groveton College adopted such a code and discontinued its old-fashioned system in which teachers closely monitored students. Under the old system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

提纲：

* 作弊人数下降的解释：第一，学生自己监管较松，甚至互相包庇；第二，老师责任更小，很多时候不及时报告或者不愿意报告。
* 对于调查结果的解释：一些学生没有真是回答内心的想法，很可能因为自我监管对于他们作弊更加方便所以他们说了假话以希望这个制度可以延续下去。
* 对于这种监管方法更为成功的论证不是充分和可信的。

A recently issued twenty-year study on headaches suffered by the residents of Mentia investigated the possible therapeutic effect of consuming salicylates （水杨酸）. Salicylates are members of the same chemical family as aspirin, a medicine used to treat headaches. Although many foods are naturally rich in salicylates, food-processing companies also add salicylates to foods as preservatives. The twenty-year study found a correlation between the rise in the commercial use of salicylates and a steady decline in the average number of headaches reported by study participants. At the time when the study concluded, food-processing companies had just discovered that salicylates can also be used as flavor additives for foods, and, as a result, many companies plan to do so. Based on these study results, some health experts predict that residents of Mentia will suffer even fewer headaches in the future.

Recently, food-processing companies have found that salicylates can also be used as flavor additives for foods.

The following was written as a part of an application for a small-business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.

"A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. Currently, the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away; thus, the proposed new jazz club in Monroe, the C-Note, would have the local market all to itself. Plus, jazz is extremely popular in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer; several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe; and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly,' which airs every weeknight at 7 P.M. Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. 

论据：

* Currently, the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away; thus, the proposed new jazz club in Monroe, the C-Note, would have the local market all to itself.
* Plus, jazz is extremely popular in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer; several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe; and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly,' which airs every weeknight at 7 P.M.
* Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment 

提纲：

* E1:常识中确实很少有人会舍近求远，但是对于Jazz Fans如果没有吸引人的歌手和节目，那么距离不是问题。他们追求的是更好的视听享受。所以需要证据证明本地俱乐部可以吸引Jazz Fans。同时这 65 miles away的距离对于Jazz Fans的交通工具来说话费的时间过于长久了。事实上，这个距离并不是特别的远大约是160公里的样子，普通汽车两个小时绝对可以。Granted that jazz is extremely popular in Monroe, we cannot ensure that those jazz fans will attend the jazz club.
* E2：虽然提到 Monroe 的Jazz很popular但是还是需要更多的证据。比如，虽然有over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer，但是有多少本地人？占总人数的多少比例？其次需要历年数据对比，比如今年是十万人，但是往年如果是30万人的话，这反而说明Jazz的魅力和受欢迎程度在不断下降。
* E3： several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe 完全可以是因为环境好，不代表他们都会在Monroe表演。The mere fact that several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe lend no significant support to the applicant's claim. 
* * E4：the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly' 这需要对比其他节目的质量，同时评分最高不代表受众最广很有可能只有少数狂热者听，但是都给高分；另一个更广泛的节目，受众的平均给分比'Jazz Nightly'低。或者其他的节目很差劲，只有这个节目很好呢？所以恰好得到了高分。The popularity of Monroe's annual jazz festival and of its nightly jazz radio show does not necessarily indicate that jazz is extremely popular in Monroe. 
* E5：这项调查的实施人首先必须公正客观中立，没有收到相关利益方的支配。The result of the nationwide study could not ensure that Monroe residents are willing to spend much money on jazz entertainment. 
* E6：全国性调查可以适用于 Monroe。
* E7：还要证明Jazz Fans的花费的很大的一部分是在俱乐部上而不是花在唱片或者自己去K歌上。即The arguer also does not inform us how much of the $1000 goes to club admission.
* E8：即使Jazz很流行，Jazz Fans很多也很愿意付费，The scale of Monroe’s jazz market, and the profitability of the proposed club are open to doubt. 比如俱乐部是不是可以良好的经营下去？是不是可以有效地管理？有没有潜在的竞争对手？是不是还有其他节目会吸引大家的注意力？

The following was written as a part of an application for a small-business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.

"Jazz music is extremely popular in the city of Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer, and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly,' which airs every weeknight. Also, a number of well-known jazz musicians own homes in Monroe. Nevertheless, the nearest jazz club is over an hour away. Given the popularity of jazz in Monroe and a recent nationwide study indicating that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment, a jazz music club in Monroe would be tremendously profitable."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

The following was written by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.

"A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. At present, the nearest jazz club is over 60 miles away from Monroe; thus, our proposed club, the C Note, would have the local market all to itself. In addition, there is ample evidence of the popularity of jazz in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's jazz festival last summer, several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe, and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly.' Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment. We therefore predict that the C Note cannot help but make money."

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.

"Commuters complain that increased rush-hour traffic on Blue Highway between the suburbs and the city center has doubled their commuting time. The favored proposal of the motorists' lobby is to widen the highway, adding an additional lane of traffic. But last year's addition of a lane to the nearby Green Highway was followed by a worsening of traffic jams on it. A better alternative is to add a bicycle lane to Blue Highway. Many area residents are keen bicyclists. A bicycle lane would encourage them to use bicycles to commute, and so would reduce rush-hour traffic rather than fostering an increase."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点： A bicycle lane would encourage them to use bicycles to commute, and so would reduce rush-hour traffic rather than fostering an increase.

论据：

* Commuters complain that increased rush-hour traffic on Blue Highway between the suburbs and the city center has doubled their commuting time. The favored proposal of the motorists' lobby is to widen the highway, adding an additional lane of traffic.
* But last year's addition of a lane to the nearby Green Highway was followed by a worsening of traffic jams on it. 
* A better alternative is to add a bicycle lane to Blue Highway. Many area residents are keen bicyclists.

提纲：

* 首先论据1中有两种人，一个是Commuters(上下班族)，一个是motorists（开车族）。是Commuters在抱怨交通拥堵，但是是Commuters本省既包含着motorists也包含这坐公共汽车上下班的人士，同时也包含其他工具比如骑自行车的人。而motorists提出的建议是增加汽车道的宽度，新增车道。但是乘坐公共汽车上下班的人是不是这么认为呢？他们可能希望设立公共汽车专用车道而不是花钱修建新的车道。这里有待疑问。
* E1：我们需要在Blue Highway上行驶的车辆的数据，比如有多少私家车，多少公共汽车，多少自行车，以及他们对于交通拥堵的影响。
* E2：我们需要讨论Green Highway和Blue Highway的可比性分析，比如是不是两者有相同的流量？两条公路的服务人口一样么？ 它们的维护状况一样么？
* E3：The increased traffic jams at Green Highway may result from other causes.
* E4：Problems emerged on Green Highway would not necessarily also take place on Blue Highway. 
* E5： Many area residents are keen bicyclists.这个是谁的结论？是不是公正，客观反映了居民的整体意愿？We need to know how many of the avid bicyclists in Shady Village are using Blue Highway for commuting, and what percentage of the whole citizens here are avid bicyclists。
* E8：同时喜欢骑自行车不代表愿意骑自行车上下班或是从市中心和郊区来回跑。是不是很远？同时天气是不是允许呢，是不是一年四季都可以骑车上下班？The result of the recent survey does not indicate that those respondents will use bicycles for daily commuting. 
* E7：The author fails to consider possible negative effects of building a bicycle lane.比如骑车的人太多会导致公路交通管理上的困难，骑自行车的人是不是遵守交通规则等。
* E8：在排除修建新的公路这个建议之前，我们至少该查明Green Highway失败的原因。才可以更加充分得在Blue highway中避免。

The following appeared as a recommendation by a committee planning a ten-year budget for the city of Calatrava.

"The birthrate in our city is declining: in fact, last year's birthrate was only one-half that of five years ago. Thus the number of students enrolled in our public schools will soon decrease dramatically, and we can safely reduce the funds budgeted for education during the next decade. At the same time, we can reduce funding for athletic playing fields and other recreational facilities. As a result, we will have sufficient money to fund city facilities and programs used primarily by adults, since we can expect the adult population of the city to increase."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：we will have sufficient money to fund city facilities and programs used primarily by adults, since we can expect the adult population of the city to increase.

论据：

* The birthrate in our city is declining: in fact, last year's birthrate was only one-half that of five years ago. Thus the number of students enrolled in our public schools will soon decrease dramatically, andthe adult population of the city to increase.
* we can safely reduce the funds budgeted for education during the next decade. At the same time, we can reduce funding for athletic playing fields and other recreational facilities. 


提纲：

* E1：建议设立的基础就是关于城市出生率的统计数据。但是这个统计数据是谁作出的报告？是政府机关还是名见机构？研究的权威性和可信度也值得我们思考。
* E2：这个数据只是说last year's birthrate was only one-half that of five years ago，并没有给出具体的数据同时没有给出这五年间人口的变化数据，所以我们无法判断人口出生率下降是长期趋势还是暂时的现象。比如去年有严重的水灾和旱灾等。
* E3：即使出生率确实下降，也不见得the number of students enrolled in our public schools will soon decrease dramatically, andthe adult population of the city to increase。首先去年出生率下降，如果以6岁为开始上学的年龄那么至少6年后入学人数才会下降。其次，出生率下降，不一定就带来成年人人口数目的增加。虽然有可能使得成人的人口比例上升。同时无法保证未来会有其他的情况，比如疾病，移民，老年人口的死亡等，导致成年人数量下降。
* E4：we can safely reduce the funds budgeted for education during the next decade这是一个完全缺少支持的论断，首先必须保证未来十年人们的生育观念不会发生变化，国家不会推出鼓励生育的政策。同时，成年人也有接受教育的需求，减少预算不是减少了成人受教育的机会？
* E5： we can reduce funding for athletic playing fields and other recreational facilities 则必须保证成年人不会使用公共的健身设施，只有小孩使用。

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of Parson City's local newspaper.

"In our region of Trillura, the majority of money spent on the schools that most students attend—the city-run public schools—comes from taxes that each city government collects. The region's cities differ, however, in the budgetary priority they give to public education. For example, both as a proportion of its overall tax revenues and in absolute terms, Parson City has recently spent almost twice as much per year as Blue City has for its public schools—even though both cities have about the same number of residents. Clearly, Parson City residents place a higher value on providing a good education in public schools than Blue City residents do."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：Clearly, Parson City residents place a higher value on providing a good education in public schools than Blue City residents do.

论据： 

* In our region of Trillura, the majority of money spent on the schools that most students attend—the city-run public schools—comes from taxes that each city government collects.
* The region's cities differ, however, in the budgetary priority they give to public education. For example, both as a proportion of its overall tax revenues and in absolute terms, Parson City has recently spent almost twice as much per year as Blue City has for its public schools—even though both cities have about the same number of residents. 

提纲：

* E1：文章引用了一个数据：In the region of Trillura, the majority of money spent on the schools that most students attend—the city-run public schools—comes from taxes that each city government collects. 那么首先这个调查数据是怎么的到？做调查的人是谁？其权威性和可靠性如何？
* E2： the majority of money 是个模糊的概念，到底多少是 the majority 有没有准确的数值区间，比如500万美元，或者每所学校的80%～90%.否则这个模糊的概念影响我们的判断。 
* E3：虽然Parson City 比 Blue City 每年的教育预算高出了一倍，但是我们不知道以前两者投入的数目对比是怎么样子的。比如Blue City可能以前投入的资金很多现在其教育设施已经饱和了。而Parson City则是刚刚开始修建新的教育设施。
* E4：The city’s budget for its public schools is not an accurate indication of the value it places on public education. 事实上可以有其他更好的指标，比如政府对于教育的开放程度，教学大纲设计的科学性，对于学生创新能力的培养，对于学校教职员工的待遇和生活条件等。同时，即使是使用教育投资作为指标的话，绝对数量并没有太大的含义The author fails to inform us what fraction of the total budget are used for public schools in each city, thus we cannot evaluate which city cares more about public school education.
* E5：both cities have about the same number of residents是一个很模糊的论述。 We do not know the amount of students who go to public schools in the two cities, thus we could not evaluate the argument. 也就是我们不清楚适龄学生的人口数量，虽然城市人口总数一样。
* E6： Many other differences between Parson City and Blue City may also contribute to the differences in the amount of money they budget for their public schools.
* E7： Parson City residents place a higher value on providing a good education in public schools than Blue City residents do并没有直接证明。即使作者通篇的论述成立也只能论证两地政府对于教育的支持程度有所不同，但是不是居民。这里偷换概念。The amount of city budgets for public schools may not represent residents’ attitude towards public school education.

The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of Quiot Manufacturing.

"During the past year, Quiot Manufacturing had 30 percent more on-the-job accidents than at the nearby Panoply Industries plant, where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours. Experts say that significant contributing factors in many on-the-job accidents are fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers. Therefore, to reduce the number of on-the-job accidents at Quiot and thereby increase productivity, we should shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour so that employees will get adequate amounts of sleep."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：Therefore, to reduce the number of on-the-job accidents at Quiot and thereby increase productivity, we should shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour so that employees will get adequate amounts of sleep.

论据：

* During the past year, Quiot Manufacturing had 30 percent more on-the-job accidents than at the nearby Panoply Industries plant, where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours. 
* Experts say that significant contributing factors in many on-the-job accidents are fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers. 

提纲：

* A1: The vice president of Quiot Manufacturing assumes that accidents are caused by fatigue or sleep deprivation. 但是可以有其他原因比如：员工有没有得到很好的安全保护；员工的技能特别是安全技能培训是否到位；工厂的安全检查是否严格；工人的操作是不是严格依照流程进行；员工的情绪和工作压力；企业的员工氛围等等。The vice  president fails to consider possible differences between Quiot and Panoply which render them incomparable.
* A2：这些专家的意见值得信赖。但是这些专家的专业背景,学术水平，职业是不是符合这两家工厂所在的行业、生产环境、员工工作特点，从而值得相信意见？
* A3：这些专家的观点足够公正不受相关利益的驱使。
* A4：The president fails to consider that the per-worker accident rate might reveal that Quiot is actually safer than Panoply, depending on the total number of workers at each company.同时的不同也可以是Panoply的工人大量使用了机械化设备降低了人的参与度。使用的时候当然可以更少的事故率。
* A5：shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour to help  employees get adequate amounts of sleep  and increase productivity这个必须依赖于一：workers would use the additional hour of free time to sleep or rest is open to doubt；其次，其他影响上班时间事故的因素可以保持不变；最后，公司员工休息的时间不会降低总的生产量，影响Quiot的竞争力。

The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of a manufacturing company.

"During the past year, workers at our newly opened factory reported 30 percent more on-the-job accidents than workers at nearby Panoply Industries. Panoply produces products very similar to those produced at our factory, but its work shifts are one hour shorter than ours. Experts say that fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers are significant contributing factors in many on-the-job accidents. Panoply's superior safety record can therefore be attributed to its shorter work shifts, which allow its employees to get adequate amounts of rest."

The following appeared in a memorandum from the planning department of an electric power company.

"Several recent surveys indicate that home owners are increasingly eager to conserve energy. At the same time, manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, that are almost twice as energy efficient as those sold a decade ago. Also, new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to reduce the energy needed for home heating. Therefore, the total demand for electricity in our area will not increase—and may decline slightly. Since our three electric generating plants in operation for the past twenty years have always met our needs, construction of new generating plants will not be necessary."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：

* the total demand for electricity in our area will not increase—and may decline slightly
* Since our three electric generating plants in operation for the past twenty years have always met our needs, construction of new generating plants will not be necessary.

论据：

* Several recent surveys indicate that home owners are increasingly eager to conserve energy. 
* At the same time, manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, that are almost twice as energy efficient as those sold a decade ago. 
* Also, new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to reduce the energy needed for home heating.

提纲：

* 首先还是调查问题，必须假设调查是公正客观，准确充分，中立可信，同时调查者没有受到相关利益方的驱使。
* The author provides no evidence that homeowners who are eager to conserve energy would purchase and use those energy-efficient home appliances.
*  We are not informed about the price of those energy-efficient home appliances and the cost of employing the new technologies, thus could not predict if residents could afford using them, and if they are willing to pay for these technologies. 
* Many factors could lead to the increase in the demand for electricity in the future.比如全球变暖会带来越来越长的空调使用时间。
* the old plants might be less energy efficient than a new plant using new technology, or might have some negative effects on environment and economic.
* The author fails to rule out many possibilities which might render one or more additional generating plants necessary. 比如大量的移民人口或者城市人口持续增加；居民使用家电的需求不会进一步增加，比如不会出现新的家电增加用点需求，比如增湿器等。
* 同时new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available  这也要假设这些新的技术使用的成本不至于太高且可以大规模使用不会带来新的安全隐患。

The vice president of human resources at Climpson Industries sent the following recommendation to the company's president.

"In an effort to improve our employees' productivity, we should implement electronic monitoring of employees' Internet use from their workstations. Employees who use the Internet from their workstations need to be identified and punished if we are to reduce the number of work hours spent on personal or recreational activities, such as shopping or playing games. By installing software to detect employees' Internet use on company computers, we can prevent employees from wasting time, foster a better work ethic at Climpson, and improve our overall profits."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：we should implement electronic monitoring of employees' Internet use from their workstations to improve our employees' productivity, 

论据：

* Employees who use the Internet from their workstations need to be identified and punished if we are to reduce the number of work hours spent on personal or recreational activities, such as shopping or playing games.
* By installing software to detect employees' Internet use on company computers, we can prevent employees from wasting time, foster a better work ethic at Climpson, and improve our overall profits.

提纲：

* The vice president fails to provide any information about current performance and productivity of our employees, thus the assumption that their productivity should be and could be improved is open to doubt.也就是必须假设现在的员工有上班玩游戏和购物的情形，否则没有必要安装软件。
* The vice president unfairly assumes that most of our employees use internet for personal or recreational activities. 必须区分使用Internet是自己消遣还是为公司工作，这一点有时候很难界定。
* 假设安装软件没有侵犯员工个人隐私而且合乎法律规定。
* 假设员工没有有效手段反监控。即监控可以有效进行。
* Employees could still spend much time on personal or recreational activities even though the Internet access is banned. 
* The vice president overlooks the negative effects of the proposed activity on employees’ morale, thus the better work ethic mentioned above is not guaranteed. 安装监控软件破坏了公司和员工之间的相互信任，同时削弱了归属感，同时监控员工可能会降低他们对于公司的感情，破坏公司工作效率。
* The vice president fails to consider possible negative effects of installing such software on the performance of computers, and fails to provide the cost of installing the software. 
* Since Climpson’s profits would be determined by many factors, adopting the proposal may not sufficiently ensure greater profits.可以使用很多的方法，比如帮助员工进行时间管理，改善业绩考核办法，增加员工归属感，在公司内部开展有趣的活动等等。

The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment complex to its manager.

"One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. I predict that modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

论点： Modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically.

论据：

* One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to one-third of what it used to be.
* Although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must pay for water each month.
* Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. 


提纲：

1. The modification was taken place only one month ago, thus many negative effects might not have emerged yet. 一个月的情况是不是可以代表全年，比如冬天的洗澡频率低于夏天。同时如果他们选择去公共浴室的话，那么数据更加不可靠。
2. 作者同时有一个假设就是这前面三栋用户可以代表后面的所有用户。这三栋楼具有足够的代表性所以可以把在这些楼的做法向所有12栋推广。但是这三栋居民的人数，沐浴习惯可以代表全体住户么？3. Without any actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment we cannot evaluate if the modification could actually save water.比如住户延长了洗澡时间，那么很难判断用水量的多少。同时，我们必须知道更换showerheads的话费和公司在水费上支持的大小，如果公司的水费开支极小的话，那么所谓的可以节省大量资金就不成立。
4. The fact that a few people complained about water pressure does not necessarily indicate that all other clients are satisfied with the modification. 
5. The owner hastily assumes that the restricting on water flow could be successfully carried out to all otherbuildings of Sunnyside Tower. 比如他们会不会搬走，或者因为水太小而私自改装 showerheads 。

The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment building to its manager.

"One month ago, all the showerheads on the first five floors of Sunnyside Towers were modified to restrict the water flow to approximately one-third of its original flow.

Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. Clearly, restricting water flow throughout all the twenty floors of Sunnyside Towers will increase our profits further."

The following report appeared in the newsletter of the West Meria Public Health Council.

"An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where fish consumption is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds. Since colds represent the most frequently given reason for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of Ichthaid—a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil—as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces.

论据：

* A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where fish consumption is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds. 
* Since colds represent the most frequently given reason for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of Ichthaid—a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil—as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism.

提纲：

* E1:A study 等同与调查的问题，所以必须查明调查是否中立，实施过程是不是合理，调查实施方是不是收到利益团体的驱动。
* E2：The fact that people in East Meria rarely visit doctor for the treatment of colds does not indicate a low incidence of colds. 还要证明他们不是对于感冒这些小病不是自己在家治疗或者自我恢复的。其次不是因为感冒去看医生，是不是经常因为其他的原因去看医生呢？也就是说多食用鱼或者其他的什么的是不是会带来易患其他的疾病？这需要证据排除，或者给出就医情况的全面数据。
* E3：The author fails to establish a causal relationship between high level of fish consumption and the low incidence of cold in East Meria. 即我们不明确是不是吃鱼带来的感冒少。或者East Meria的居民生活方式更加健康，环境污染更少，更加注意锻炼休息，或者East Meria人口结构更加年轻，生病的人数自然会少一些。
* E4：The condition in East and West Meria may not be comparable.所以作者需要证明这两者的可比较性，他们的经济水平相当，环境气候一致，没有什么大的不同。
* E5：We need to know how many absences from school and work were actually caused by colds. 也就是 West Meria 的缺席现象是由于感冒引起的。而不仅仅是有可能用来搪塞的借口。
* E5：同时作者需要说明eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds中的a substantial amount of fish是多少，多少条鱼算够，推荐用量是多少。鱼的烹饪方法是不是有影响？还有鱼的种类是不是有影响？
* E6：Ichthaid may not have the same function in preventing colds as has eating fish.作者对于论证说的是East Meria居民吃鱼的好处，但是推荐的Ichthaid。即使Ichthaid是a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil，但是光是鱼油的提炼物会不会和鱼肉有什么不同？同时还需要给出每天的用量，这些用量是不是科学呢？是不是没有什么毒副作用呢？
* E7：同时作者需要证明大家都可以负担这些营养品的费用。The author does not inform us the cost, and any possible side effects of Ichtahaid.
* E8：同时需要证明这种提炼物或者多食用这种鱼类不会因为感冒病毒的变异，或者气候的变化等等外部因素失去作用；也就是他们的效用是长期而且可靠的。

The following memo appeared in the newsletter of the West Meria Public Health Council.

"An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where consumption of the plant beneficia is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of beneficia can prevent colds. Since colds are the reason most frequently given for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia. We predict this will dramatically reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

同上，只是换成 West Meria Public Health Council且换了一个东东：beneficia，（这个在google的结果中是西班牙语ETS杜撰的东东吧）。

The following appeared in a recommendation from the planning department of the city of Transopolis.

"Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the entire city increased. To further revitalize the city, we should now take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city. Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action will be readily available."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：To further revitalize the city, we should now take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city. 

论据：

* Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the entire city increased.
* Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action will be readily available.


提纲：

* E1： The author unfairly assumes that the prosperity of the area results from the industrialization. 比如很有可能这段时间国家的经济整体形式很好，所以社会就业充分，自然犯罪率会下降而资产税会上升。
* E2：The author fails to demonstrate that the residential area on the opposite side of the city is suitable for industrial use.
* E3：这些居民愿意搬迁，同时接纳地区的居民愿意接纳这些移民。否则容易造成社会的动荡。同时搬迁居民必然牵涉到配套设施的规划，比如学校，医院，养老院，购物中心，道路交通，垃圾中转设施的布局容量是不是合理，公共资源和服务可以满足新增的需求。最后是就业岗位的安排，是不是可以完全接纳的关键。The author fails to consider if the residents of the area are willing to be allocated to those houses and apartments.
* E4： The two areas may not be comparable at many aspects, thus taking similar action in the area may not generate the same good effects. What's more, The author fails to substantiate the necessity of adapt more area for industrial use. 
* E5：Many factors that would influence the effectiveness of the action would have changed during the past decade. 十年前的政策，现在是不是依然可以成功呢？
* E6：Other possible solutions could also be used to revitalize the city. 
* E7：The author fails to consider the cost of the proposed action, and if the city could afford it.

The following appeared in a memo from the new vice president of Sartorian, a company that manufactures men's clothing.

"Five years ago, at a time when we had difficulties in obtaining reliable supplies of high quality wool fabric, we discontinued production of our alpaca overcoat. Now that we have a new fabric supplier, we should resume production. This coat should sell very well: since we have not offered an alpaca overcoat for five years and since our major competitor no longer makes an alpaca overcoat, there will be pent-up customer demand. Also, since the price of most types of clothing has increased in each of the past five years, customers should be willing to pay significantly higher prices for alpaca overcoats than they did five years ago, and our company profits will increase."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：

* We should resume production of our alpaca overcoat.
* This coat should sell very well. 

论据：

* Five years ago, at a time when we had difficulties in obtaining reliable supplies of high quality wool fabric, we discontinued production of our alpaca overcoat. Now that we have a new fabric supplier
* since we have not offered an alpaca overcoat for five years and since our major competitor no longer makes an alpaca overcoat, there will be pent-up customer demand.
* since the price of most types of clothing has increased in each of the past five years, customers should be willing to pay significantly higher prices for alpaca overcoats than they did five years ago, and our company profits will increase.


提纲：

* The author fails to substantiate the assumption that the new fabric sup­plier will be a reliable supplier of alpaca, and fails to provide any information about the quality of the fabric they supply.也就是没有证明新的fabric sup­plie可以代替原来的面料，同时也可以生产出同样档次的产品。
* 即使这种产品质量和五年前一样，但是The author fails to consider the possible cost of resuming production也就是我们是不是还需要购置新的机器或者改造生产线；工人是不是要重新培训？这些都需要证据。
* Other factors may change during the past five years. 比如流行的风向是不是改变，消费者是不是还会喜欢alpaca overcoat。至少需要提供消费者关于alpaca overcoat的印象调查和消费者的购买意愿。
* The assumption that consumers will be willing to pay significant higher prices for alpaca overcoats is unwarranted.
* 同时需要假设alpaca overcoat上市后，没有其他厂商不会跟进生产同类产品来和alpaca overcoat竞争才可以保证高利润。The memo's claim that the company's overall profits would increase thereby is unwar­ranted.
* 同时如果alpaca overcoat真的有巨大的需求的话，同类型厂商五年内都没有生产alpaca overcoat来填补市场，如果不是技术原因，这不是很好说明alpaca overcoat没有巨大的需求么？

A recent sales study indicates that consumption of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants has increased by 30 percent during the past five years. Yet there are no currently operating city restaurants whose specialty is seafood. Moreover, the majority of families in Bay City are two-income families, and a nationwide study has shown that such families eat significantly fewer home-cooked meals than they did a decade ago but at the same time express more concern about healthful eating. Therefore, the new Captain Seafood restaurant that specializes in seafood should be quite popular and profitable.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：the new Captain Seafood restaurant that specializes in seafood should be quite popular and profitable.

论据：

* A recent sales study indicates that consumption of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants has increased by 30 percent during the past five years.
* Yet there are no currently operating city restaurants whose specialty is seafood. 
* Moreover, the majority of families in Bay City are two-income families, and a nationwide study has shown that such families eat significantly fewer home-cooked meals than they did a decade ago but at the same time express more concern about healthful eating.

提纲：

* 调查是首先怀疑的。调查者是谁？中立，客观，公正，没有利益瓜葛；同时专业水平和素养值得信赖。调查方案的设计是否科学没有倾向性。同时实施的过程严格依照相关的程序规定进行。
* 其次，The 30% increase might be insignificant because we do not know the base amount of seafood consumption in Bay City. 比如原来的海鲜消费很低，那么即使有很大的30%的提高那么其实也不是很多的海鲜消费。
* 同时没有告诉我们同期其他食物种类增加数量的比较。比如其他产品消耗量比海鲜大，同时增加幅度还比海鲜多，那么我们不能够得出海鲜产品可以盈利。
* The past current does not necessarily indicate that seafood consumption will continue to increase in the future.
* The increase in consumption of seafood dishes in normal restaurant does not indicate that a restaurant specializing in seafood will be profitable.也就是没有说明为什么Bay City没有海鲜专营餐馆的问题。这个市场空白是不是由于一些不可抗拒因素？是不是当地的气候不适合长期食用海鲜产品？是不是当地没有及时和新鲜的海鲜原料供应？
* The nationwide study showing trends among two-income families toward dining out and eating healthily does not necessarily apply to Bay City. 
*  Without any detailed data concerning the number of home-cooked meals these two-income families eat currently and formerly, and without knowing the actual level of their concern about eating healthily, we cannot evaluate if these families are a key factor in determining the profitability of a restaurant specializing in seafood. Other families may eat even fewer home-cooked meals and are concerned more about eating healthily.所以The fact that two-income families eat fewer home-cooked meals may lead to the popularity of catering services, delivered meals, but not necessarily that of a 海鲜 restaurant. 
* The fact that two-income families express more concern about eating healthily does not indicate that they will necessarily patronize a new seafood restaurant. 也就是说，双职工家庭不一定把这家海鲜餐馆视为健康饮食的地方。
* The argument fails to provide any information about the expense of establishing such a restaurant.也就是没有说明建海鲜餐馆的成本问题。

Milk and dairy products are rich in vitamin D and calcium—substances essential for building and maintaining bones. Many people therefore say that a diet rich in dairy products can help prevent osteoporosis, a disease that is linked to both environmental and genetic factors and that causes the bones to weaken significantly with age. But a long-term study of a large number of people found that those who consistently consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study. Since bone fractures are symptomatic of osteoporosis, this study result shows that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase, rather than decrease, the risk of osteoporosis.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：this study result shows that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase, rather than decrease, the risk of osteoporosis.

论据：

*  a long-term study of a large number of people found that those who consistently consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study. 
* Bone fractures are symptomatic of osteoporosis

提纲：

* 首先还是调查。我们需要进一步的数据证明这些调查的方案设计(比如调查样本的抽取，调查方法的选择，调查数据的处理和验证)以及调查过程的实施这些都是科学与合理的。其次，我们必须保证结论是客观公正的。调查者的专业资质可靠，同时没有相关的利益瓜葛。
* 同时调查给出的数据很模糊，a long-term是多少年？a large number of people是多少人。同时这些人是不是具有足够的代表性。他们饮食，年龄，生活环境，作息习惯没有特别的倾向。
* The author does not provide detailed information about the studied people who consistently consume dairy products and those who do not.即作者没有设置严格的对照组。虽然those who consistently consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study，但是如果可以有更严格的对照组比如没有喝过奶制品的人作为对照，那么结果将更加可信。
* Although bone fractures are a symptom of osteoporosis, they may well result from other causes. Other reasons, such as aging, genetic factors, lifestyle, etc. may also account for the higher rate of bone fractures of the people mentioned in the study. 
* 同时，对于文中观点所说的这种病症osteoporosis能不能简单通过Bone fractures来进行诊断呢？我们可以使用其它更加可靠的方法来确认。而不是只通过一个症状来确定。

The following appeared in a health newsletter.

"A ten-year nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a helmet while bicycling indicates that ten years ago, approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets, whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent. Another study, however, suggests that during the same ten-year period, the number of bicycle-related accidents has increased 200 percent. These results demonstrate that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets, and they take more risks as a result. Thus, to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents, the government should concentrate more on educating people about bicycle safety and less on encouraging or requiring bicyclists to wear helmets."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* Another study, however, suggests that during the same ten-year period, the number of bicycle-related accidents has increased 200 percent.

提纲：

* 有调查存在，所以必然写调查类的问题。首先，作者必须假设这些调查都是公正的。其次假设调查的方法，取样，数据处理，结果的核实和验证都是可靠的。实施者没有任何偏颇之处。
* 作者的论据强调了因为戴了头盔所以松懈大意导致事故数反而升高了。这必须假设：
   * 现在的安全帽和过去一样，才可以类比。如果说安全帽的质量出现了大的下滑，原来用的是红色醒目的安全帽，现在却使用了不醒目颜色的安全帽。
   * 没有其他因素导致安全事故。比如：现在自行车设计的缺陷增多了；自行车驾驶者的数量增加；没有足够的自行车道路；机动车数量激增；行人和车手不遵守交通规则；交通管理和规划的不合理。
   
   
* 即使我们知道安全事故很多，但是还是无法支持论点2的合理性。也就是作者必须假定：安全教育可以改善自行车手的安全意识并且安全意识提高可以发挥减少交通事故作用；人们可以在这些教育发挥作用的同时坚持下去，而不会荒废；同时自行车也会是主要交通工具而不会出现因为使用自行车的人的减少导致的事故数的减少。

The following is a letter to the head of the tourism bureau on the island of Tria.

"Erosion of beach sand along the shores of Tria Island is a serious threat to our island and our tourist industry. In order to stop the erosion, we should charge people for using the beaches. Although this solution may annoy a few tourists in the short term, it will raise money for replenishing the sand. Replenishing the sand, as was done to protect buildings on the nearby island of Batia, will help protect buildings along our shores, thereby reducing these buildings' risk of additional damage from severe storms. And since beaches and buildings in the area will be preserved, Tria's tourist industry will improve over the long term."

*  And since beaches and buildings in the area will be preserved, Tria's tourist industry will improve over the long term.

提纲：

* 论据1指明岛上的沙子流失严重，作者必须提供证据是谁得到的这个结论，怎么知道沙子流失严重的。如果是调查得到的结论则需要指明调查者是可靠权威的相关领域专家。同时他们的方法是科学合理的，做出的结论是公正的，没有受到想过利益方的影响。
* 论据 2告诉我们有部分游客会不满，那么作者需要给出更多的证据指明大部分游客不会因为这项政策而不来了。也就是大部分游客还会来沙滩游玩不至于受到新增收费的影响。比如作者可以提供一个对于游客的问卷意向调查等。
* 论据3的类比，必须提供说明，Batia岛和Tria岛是可以类比的。它们的海洋环境，沙滩构成，海潮冲击力这些都是可以类比。同时，如果是修补建筑的话，也必须证明Batia岛和Tria岛的建筑是类似的，可以利用文中提到的技术进行修补，可以顶住海风和雨水的侵蚀。也就是这些楼本身值得我们修补。
* 论据4说明如果楼房好那么旅游业会好。这也需要证据：比如没有其他 不利因素的存在，如经济环境不会有萧条，旅游客不会减少；附近的岛屿不会与Tria岛竞争；旅游项目可以保持良好的效果。

The following appeared in a memorandum written by the chairperson of the West Egg Town Council.

"Two years ago, consultants predicted that West Egg's landfill, which is used for garbage disposal, would be completely filled within five years. During the past two years, however, the town's residents have been recycling twice as much material as they did in previous years. Next month the amount of recycled material—which includes paper, plastic, and metal—should further increase, since charges for pickup of other household garbage will double. Furthermore, over 90 percent of the respondents to a recent survey said that they would do more recycling in the future. Because of our town's strong commitment to recycling, the available space in our landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：the available space in our landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted.

论据：

* Two years ago, consultants predicted that West Egg's landfill, which is used for garbage disposal, would be completely filled within five years. During the past two years, however, the town's residents have been recycling twice as much material as they did in previous years.
* Next month the amount of recycled material—which includes paper, plastic, and metal—should further increase, since charges for pickup of other household garbage will double.
* Furthermore, over 90 percent of the respondents to a recent survey said that they would do more recycling in the future.
* More and more residents in our town will make strong commitment to recycling

提纲：

* 文中使用了大量的调查数据，这些数据的得到必须基于调查研究。所以他们必定需要证明这些数据是使用可靠地方法得到的，这些数据的处理是科学合理的。实现这些数据调查的人士中立，客观的。
* 其次，即使这些数据都是真是的，我们依然需要证明两年前居民回收垃圾的数量就很多，只有这样才可以说明：200%的增加是可以为减少占用垃圾场做出贡献度。
* 论据2使用了，常识性论证的假设：那就是提高收垃圾的费用，会刺激人们回收垃圾以减少垃圾数量，降低生活开销。但是这建立在以下假设的基础上：
    * 原来的收垃圾费用倍增后，可以让居民显著改变生活成本。从而促使他们有动力改变生活成本。
    * 同时必须指明recycled material—which includes paper, plastic, and metal和将要增加the pickup of other household garbage在垃圾中所占的比例。也就是说这样费用的增加可以改变垃圾的数量。如果其他类别的垃圾过少那么这个政策的可靠性事实上存疑。
    * 同时下个月可回收垃圾数量增加，这是一个趋势，我们需要知道这个趋势可以延续多久。会不会因为个别原因导致这个趋势无法延续？
* 论据3，同样是调查。但是这个调查的结果需要证据支持是具有代表性的居民，被调查者真实反映了自己的想法。同时在居民有意愿的基础上需要知道他们是不是拥有这样的能力，也就是居民是不是有条件妥善合理地分类垃圾。
* 同时这些都成立也无法保证垃圾填埋场的数量。比如，我们需要知道是不是会有大量的移民进入导致垃圾数量增加占用填埋设施。或者填埋场管理不善导致实际使用中损失了大量的可用空间？

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a journal on environmental issues.

"Over the past year, the Crust Copper Company (CCC) has purchased over 10,000 square miles of land in the tropical nation of West Fredonia. Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in pollution and, since West Fredonia is the home of several endangered animal species, in environmental disaster. But such disasters can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with CCC's copper unless the company abandons its mining plans."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：such disasters can be prevented

论据：

* Over the past year, the Crust Copper Company (CCC) has purchased over 10,000 square miles of land in the tropical nation of West Fredonia.
* Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in pollution and, since West Fredonia is the home of several endangered animal species, in environmental disaster. 
* But such disasters can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with CCC's copper unless the company abandons its mining plans.

提纲：

* 假设1：CCC公司买地就是为了开发铜矿。如果CCC为了提高自己的形象，从而对所买土地实施保护呢？或者CCC公司是为了转型发展，准备开发旅游产业呢？同时假设了CCC买的土地上必须有铜矿，而这个并没有实际证据的支持。
* 假设2：CCC公司的开矿必然导致污染。但是如果CCC实施严格的环保措施，或者CCC有先进的工艺使得污染可以减轻很多呢？
* uch disasters can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with CCC's copper 这是市场集体抵制行为(boycott)，结构如下：
    * 大前提：集体的市场抵制会是公司放弃不利于环境的生产计划
    * 小前提：消费者不买CCC的产品是有效地市场集体抵制行为
    * 结论：CCC公司会放弃开采计划
* 所需要的假设如下：
    * 人们可以很容易地识别CCC的产品
    * 人们可以统一的采取行动即都愿意加入到抵制计划中去
    * 该抵制计划不会额外产生大量的失业，也就是不会让人们因为成本过高而放弃
    * 同时，必须保证不会有其他公司代替CCC开发不然这项集体抵制计划实际上没有任何作用。

The following is part of a memorandum from the president of Humana University.

"Last year the number of students who enrolled in online degree programs offered by nearby Omni University increased by 50 percent. During the same year, Omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space, most likely because instruction in the online programs takes place via the Internet. In contrast, over the past three years, enrollment at Humana University has failed to grow, and the cost of maintaining buildings has increased along with our budget deficit. To address these problems, Humana University will begin immediately to create and actively promote online degree programs like those at Omni. We predict that instituting these online degree programs will help Humana both increase its total enrollment and solve its budget problems."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

论点：

* Humana University will begin immediately to create and actively promote online degree programs like those at Omni.
* instituting these online degree programs will help Humana both increase its total enrollment and solve its budget problems.

论据：

* Last year the number of students who enrolled in online degree programs offered by nearby Omni University increased by 50 percent. During the same year, Omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space, most likely because instruction in the online programs takes place via the Internet.
*  In contrast, over the past three years, enrollment at Humana University has failed to grow, and the cost of maintaining buildings has increased along with our budget deficit. 


提纲：

* We do not know the actual number of students who enrolled in long-distance program at Omni University last year, thus the 50% increase might be insignificant. 
* 同时我们需要其他大学的例子来支持Omni的例子不是个例。也说明50%的增长是值得我们效法的，比如其他大学如果人数比Omni更多，增长更大，那么我们是不是该学习另外的学校呢？
* 我们需要更详细的第三方机构做出的关于网上教学和传统教学影响或者说效果的对比及相关的数据而不是简单地比照几所大学的例子。
* We do not know the total number of enrollment, and actual tuition income at Omni last year. 
* Other factors may well explain the decrease in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space at Omni.比如，Omni大学是不是因为传统住校人数过少而不得不通过网上教学吧来维持学校呢？
* Possibly Omni and Humana are not comparable at many aspects. 比如这两所学校的教学项目，教学年龄段的人口数（是不是老年大学？），经济发展水平。
* The president does not provide any information about the cost and any possible requirements of installing such a program. 同时也没有说明Humana的赤字是什么原因导致的。如果是因为工资水平的普遍上涨或者通货膨胀那么改变教学事实上的作用有多大呢？
* The president overlooks other methods that could be applied to solve the problem.

"Last year the number of students who enrolled in online degree programs offered by nearby Omni University increased by 50 percent. During the same year, Omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space, most likely because online instruction takes place via the Internet. In contrast, over the past three years, enrollment at Humana University has failed to grow and the cost of maintaining buildings has increased. Thus, to increase enrollment and solve the problem of budget deficits at Humana University, we should initiate and actively promote online degree programs like those at Omni."

The following appeared in a health magazine published in Corpora.

"Medical experts say that only one-quarter of Corpora's citizens meet the current standards for adequate physical fitness, even though twenty years ago, one-half of all of Corpora's citizens met the standards as then defined. But these experts are mistaken when they suggest that spending too much time using computers has caused a decline in fitness. Since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of Corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest, it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit. Instead, as shown by this year's unusually low expenditures on fitness-related products and services, the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause, and fitness levels will improve when the economy does."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：

* But these experts are mistaken when they suggest that spending too much time using computers has caused a decline in fitness
* he recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause, and fitness levels will improve when the economy does.


论据：

* Since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of Corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest, it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit. 
* as shown by this year's unusually low expenditures on fitness-related products and services, the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause

提纲：

* 作者使用逆否命题的方法：如果专家：that spending too much time using computers has caused a decline in fitness的观点对的，那么逆否就是：高健康的区域可以看到低的使用电脑的时间。现在真实存在的情形是overall fitness levels are highest in regions of Corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest，所以作者说专家的观点错误了。 
* 但是如果说不是电脑导致了体质下降，基于以下假设：拥有电脑多的人使用电脑的时间也长。但是这个是不一定的，有人因为专业原因比如在家修电脑。或者是一个很自律的人，使用电脑的时间不一定很长。这样才可以把作者说的真实中某地拥有电脑率的多和使用电脑时间联系起来，才可以反驳专家观点。High levels of computer ownership do not indicate that citizens of these regions will spend more time on using computers. 
* 作者说recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause of decrease in fitness levels。这个观点也需要证据，也就是假设不存在其他原因比如：居民生活节奏的变化，人口结构的改变，外来移民变化。同时，即使是经济下滑，也不一定是：this year's unusually low expenditures on fitness-related products and services导致体质下降。可能是环境的恶化，气候的变迁，青壮年的大量移出，或者人们对于保健品有疑虑等。The low expenditures on fitness-related products and services may not directly result in low level of fitness. The low expenditures on fitness-related products do not necessarily resulted from the decline in the economy. 
* 小错误：The standard for fitness may vary during past 20 years.
* Although the regions mentioned by the author have relatively highest fitness levels, it is still possible that their fitness levels are declining compared with themselves. 
* The author fails to convince us that once the economy improves, people will spend more money on fitness-related products and services, and their fitness levels will therefore be improved.

The following appeared in a memorandum from the owner of Movies Galore, a chain of movie-rental stores.

"Because of declining profits, we must reduce operating expenses at Movies Galore's ten movie-rental stores. Raising prices is not a good option, since we are famous for our low prices. Instead, we should reduce our operating hours. Last month our store in downtown Marston reduced its hours by closing at 6:00 p.m. rather than 9:00 p.m. and reduced its overall inventory by no longer stocking any DVD released more than five years ago. Since we have received very few customer complaints about these new policies, we should now adopt them at all other Movies Galore stores as our best strategies for improving profits."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：Because of declining profits, we must reduce operating expenses at Movies Galore's ten movie-rental stores by reducing our operating hours and its overall inventory by no longer stocking any DVD released more than five years ago.

论据：

* Raising prices is not a good option, since we are famous for our low prices.

提纲：

* The owner fails to sufficiently illustrate that why raising prices would not be a good solution for improving profits. 比如我们需要知道3个小时的运营成本在和获得的利润相比较。其次，我们需要知道竞争对手的情况才可以决定是不是将这项政策推向更多的店铺。其次作者人为限定可选择方法，难道不可以涨价就没有其他方法？比如，降低工资，强调节约意识。There are many other possible measures we can adopt to improve profits.
* The owner fails to provide any information concerning the possible change in the profit of the store in Marston after the policies were adopted, thus we cannot evaluate if we should adopt them at all other stores. 
* The fact that few customer complaints were received does not indicate that most customers are satisfied with these policies.
* The new policies were implemented only one month ago, the situation of this month might not be representative of that of the whole year, or the negative effects might not have emerged yet. 
* The success of the new policies at one store does not ensure that adopting them would necessarily be successful at all other Armchair stores. 
* The owner fails to consider many negative effects of the new policies.比如，减少库存可能让很多顾客认为选择过少而不来光顾。同时，新的时间可能不是顾客最最方便的时间，比如不是顾客下班后的时间，也就是说可以减少时间。但是如何安排减少后的时间，需要科学规划。
注意：in downtown Marston 这个特殊的地点。不是任何地方都可以成为downtown的。

The following appeared in a magazine article about planning for retirement.

"Clearview should be a top choice for anyone seeking a place to retire, because it has spectacular natural beauty and a consistent climate. Another advantage is that housing costs in Clearview have fallen significantly during the past year, and taxes remain lower than those in neighboring towns. Moreover, Clearview's mayor promises many new programs to improve schools, streets, and public services. And best of all, retirees in Clearview can also expect excellent health care as they grow older, since the number of physicians in the area is far greater than the national average."

提纲：

* it has spectacular natural beauty and a consistent climate.并不能说明气候适合老年人生活。比如：沙漠的气候也可以由壮美的景色(沙海)，稳定的气候(酷热)。
* The variation in the housing costs does not indicate that Clearview has advantage in housing costs. 我们要知道低到何种程度是不是适合老年人的退休金。We need to know the average real estate taxes of the whole nation, non-neighboring cities might enjoy even lower real estate taxes. 
* We do not know other conditions in Clearview which would influence retirees’ decisions, such as commodity price, transportation, etc.
* We cannot guarantee that housing costs in Clearview will not increase in the future. 
* We do not know if the mayor can keep his promise, and how long does it take to finish those improvements. The mayor’s promise might just indicate that those facilities are in bad condition now. 
* The number of physicians does not necessarily indicate the quality of health care.这知道单一的physicians 内科医生不代表全部的各个种类的医生很多。
* Although the number of physicians in Clearview is relatively high, the per capita number might be relatively low.其次要知道这些一生的医术和受教育 程度。如果单单考察医疗条件可以看看死亡率，医疗事故比例等。

An ancient, traditional remedy for insomnia—the scent of lavender flowers—has now been proved effective. In a recent study, 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia slept each night for three weeks on lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was monitored electronically. During the first week, volunteers continued to take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but wakened feeling tired. At the beginning of the second week, the volunteers discontinued their sleeping medication. During that week, they slept less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. During the third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the previous two weeks. Therefore, the study proves that lavender cures insomnia within a short period of time.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：a study proves that lavender cures insomnia within a short period of time

论据：

* In a recent study, 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia slept each night for three weeks on lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was monitored electronically. During the first week, volunteers continued to take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but wakened feeling tired. 
* At the beginning of the second week, the volunteers discontinued their sleeping medication. During that week, they slept less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. 
* During the third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the previous two weeks. 

提纲：

* 30 volunteers are too small a sample that can hardly be representative. We do not have any detailed information about the 30 volunteers, e.g. the severity of their insomnia, their physique, etc., thus we could not evaluate if they are representative. The author does not inform us about the volunteers' sleep patterns prior to the experiment. (
* How soundly or long a person sleeps, or how tired a person feels after sleep, is irrelevant to whether the person suffers from insomnia. 同时我们无法从患者的反馈中客观设立soundly or long a person sleeps的标准，这个怎么测量？
* The study fails to inform us how the volunteers felt after sleep during the third week, thus we could not evaluate the actual effect of lavender flowers on sleep. 也就是说，前两周有效不代表第三周有效，说不定只是治标，或者两周有效，第三周反而更加严重了。
* 正确的实验设计必须含有对照组：The study should include another group of people who do not sleep on such pillows as counterparts. 
* Granted that the volunteer’s sleep was improved through the three weeks, we cannot ensure it is the lavender that caused the result, other factors could also account for the improvement.比如心里暗示作用。
* The author cannot hastily conclude that the volunteers’ insomnia has been thoroughly cured without any follow-up studies.

The following appeared in a health magazine.

"The citizens of Forsythe have adopted more healthful lifestyles. Their responses to a recent survey show that in their eating habits they conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago. Furthermore, there has been a fourfold increase in sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol. This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few of the most healthy citizens regularly eat."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

论点：The citizens of Forsythe have adopted more healthful lifestyles. 

论据：

* Their responses to a recent survey show that in their eating habits they conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago. 
* Furthermore, there has been a fourfold increase in sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol. 
* This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few of the most healthy citizens regularly eat.

提纲：

* The reliability of the recent survey is open to doubt, who responded? The number of respondents? 被采访者是不是因为从众心理或者怕他人嘲笑而说谎？
* 政府的健康计划也需要更多的证据支持The government nutritional recommendations do not necessarily represent standards of healthy lifestyles 。因为说不定政府的计划只是为了保证每个人的营养吸收设立了最低标准。同时The government nutritional recommendations may have changed during the past decade. 所以10年前的计划和10年后的计划是不是可以对比呢？
* The increase in sales of food products containing kiran does not necessarily indicate that the citizens are leading healthier lives, people may purchase these food products for other reasons.比如经济下滑，人们不得不吃含着个营养素的便宜食物。同时，作者没有提供吃这些食物的是少数人还是多数人。如果是少数人买了很多那也不代表什么。其次，作者没有说明是不是有很多的移民进入，如果这样的话，销量确实会上升但是不代表居民使用的比例上升。所以事实上没有任何影响。至少需要其他营养食物的比如，含有Vitamin，Calcium，Unsaturated Fatty acid等食物的销量。如果他们销量增加20或者总量远远超过Kiran事实上，Kiran的作用也就被削弱了。
* 同时sulia, a food that few of the most healthy citizens regularly eat。最健康的人很少吃不代表不健康。所以需要更多独立科研机构的权威数据论证。The fact that few of the healthiest citizens regularly eat sulia does not demonstrate that sulia is unhealthy.
* 减少sulia的食用量，也有可能是因为环境改变sulia的常量减少了。现在很难买到或者需要从别的地方进口，太贵了都是可能的原因。
* 作者文章中使用归纳推理的方法。说明居民饮食习惯健康了，从而推论他们的生活习惯更健康，这里错误假设了饮食习惯代表生活习惯。但是The author ignores many other factors that could be used to evaluate if people are having healthier lives. 比如这里的居民运动习惯如何？文娱活动多么？他们生活节奏怎么样？生态环境有没有污染。社会心态等等。

Benton City residents have adopted healthier lifestyles. A recent survey of city residents shows that the eating habits of city residents conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago. During those ten years, local sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol, have increased fourfold, while sales of sulia, a food rarely eaten by the healthiest residents, have declined dramatically. Because of these positive changes in the eating habits of Benton City residents, we predict that the obesity rate in the city will soon be well below the national average.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands had become extinct. Yet humans cannot have been a factor in the species' extinctions, because there is no evidence that the humans had any significant contact with the mammals. Further, archaeologists have discovered numerous sites where the bones of fish had been discarded, but they found no such areas containing the bones of large mammals, so the humans cannot have hunted the mammals. Therefore, some climate change or other environmental factor must have caused the species' extinctions.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：Yet humans cannot have been a factor in the species' extinctions， some climate change or other environmental factor must have caused the species' extinctions.

论据：

*  because there is no evidence that the humans had any significant contact with the mammals.
*  Further, archaeologists have discovered numerous sites where the bones of fish had been discarded, but they found no such areas containing the bones of large mammals, so the humans cannot have hunted the mammals. 

提纲：

文章中使用了两个演绎推理：

* 论据1的具体过程如下：
    * 大前提：如果人类导致灭绝，人类该有和此类动物密切接触的痕迹
    * 小前提：没有痕迹
    * 结论：人类不会导致动物灭绝
* 论据2的推理如下：
    * 大前提：如果人类猎杀了动物，动物的骨头该可以找到
    * 小前提：没有找到骨头
    * 结论：人类不会猎杀动物
* 综合以上结果作者说不是人导致此类动物灭绝。

所以可以攻击如下：

* 作者论据1的大前提有问题。The argument treats a lack of proof that if humans might be responsible for the extinctions ，then there must the evidence that showing significant contact between humans and the mammals.
* The fact that no evidence showing significant contact between humans and the mammals has been found does not sufficiently prove that there was no any such contact at all.
* Even if humans had no significant contact with mammals, human activities might cause negative effects on mammals in different ways, thus human activities might have caused the species’ extinctions indirectly. 比如人类砍伐森林，或者人类携带了对那些动物致命的病菌，或者人类引入或者抚养了那种动物的天敌。The author ignores other factors besides climate change and environmental ones that could also explain the extinctions. 
* The fact that no bones of large mammals were found at the sites does not sufficiently demonstrate that humans have not hunted those mammals.骨头可能做其他用途了，比如扔到河里冲走了，或者祭祀烧掉了，埋掉了。
* 没发现骨头也有可能是The author fails to prove that those discovered sites were inhabited by humans. 比如人类现在又酸雨腐蚀，等等。

Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands were extinct. Previous archaeological findings have suggested that early humans generally relied on both fishing and hunting for food; since archaeologists have discovered numerous sites in the Kaliko Islands where the bones of fish were discarded, it is likely that the humans also hunted the mammals. Furthermore, researchers have uncovered simple tools, such as stone knives, that could be used for hunting. The only clear explanation is that humans caused the extinction of the various mammal species through excessive hunting.

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

The following appeared in an editorial in a business magazine.

"Although the sales of Whirlwind video games have declined over the past two years, a recent survey of video-game players suggests that this sales trend is about to be reversed. The survey asked video-game players what features they thought were most important in a video game. According to the survey, players prefer games that provide lifelike graphics, which require the most up-to-date computers. Whirlwind has just introduced several such games with an extensive advertising campaign directed at people ten to twenty-five years old, the age-group most likely to play video games. It follows, then, that the sales of Whirlwind video games are likely to increase dramatically in the next few months."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：that the sales of Whirlwind video games are likely to increase dramatically in the next few months.

论据：

* The survey asked video-game players what features they thought were most important in a video game. According to the survey, players prefer games that provide lifelike graphics, which require the most up-to-date computers. 
* Whirlwind has just introduced several such games with an extensive advertising campaign directed at people ten to twenty-five years old, the age-group most likely to play video games. 

提纲：

* 首先是调查。这个老生常谈的问题，科学，合理，公正。其次是，作者用对于游戏玩家进行的调查，但是对于游戏而言还有游戏设计人员，运营商，业内专家等，他们的观点也值得参考。同时对于这个问题是玩家更喜欢玩哪种游戏，不代表玩家就会这类游戏。这还牵涉到他们是不是可以负担得起费用的问题。The author fails to take into account other factors that might also lead to the decline in their sales of video games. The author fails to consider other features that may also influence the overall quality of a game.
* The author fails to analyze how many players have access to such most up-to-date computers. 电脑性能也是制约因素。
* No evidence could indicate that players 10-25 years old will also prefer such kind of games. 
* Sales of video games would be determined by many factors, thus the mere fact cited by the author could not ensure increase in our sales. 比如宏观经济状况，竞争对手。

* The study cited by the vice president does not imply that our customers no longer care about the durability of socks. 顾客喜欢颜色式样不代表必须放弃袜子的耐穿度。
* 最后不用Endure 工艺可以盈利的问题是：The vice president fails to inform us the cost of using “Endure” process, thus we cannot evaluate the president’s conclusion. The vice president fails to consider the negative effect of discontinuing the use of the process. 比如消费者其实更加喜欢我们的耐穿袜其次他们才考虑颜色式样呢？不用这种工艺是不是要换新的生产线，这个的先期投入是不是入不敷出呢？

The following appeared in a memo from the president of Bower Builders, a company that constructs new homes.

"A nationwide survey reveals that the two most-desired home features are a large family room and a large, well-appointed kitchen. A number of homes in our area built by our competitor Domus Construction have such features and have sold much faster and at significantly higher prices than the national average. To boost sales and profits, we should increase the size of the family rooms and kitchens in all the homes we build and should make state-of-the-art kitchens a standard feature. Moreover, our larger family rooms and kitchens can come at the expense of the dining room, since many of our recent buyers say they do not need a separate dining room for family meals."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：To boost sales and profits, we should increase the size of the family rooms and kitchens in all the homes we build and should make state-of-the-art kitchens a standard feature.

*  Moreover, our larger family rooms and kitchens can come at the expense of the dining room, since many of our recent buyers say they do not need a separate dining room for family meals.


提纲：

* The result of the nationwide survey does not necessarily apply to all specific regions. 
* The president unfairly assumes that it is the large family room and the large, well-appointed kitchen that resulted in the fast selling and higher price of the development built by Domus. 比如还有其他原因：Domus施工质量一流，空间设计，室内装修以及市场营销手段更加优秀。或者有良好的物业管理，绝佳的地理位置。
* The president fails to provide any information about the profits Domus gained from the mentioned development.房子卖得快卖得贵不代表利润高还看成本，如果是亏本赚吆喝那么其实也不值得效法。至少是不值得全部效法。
* 即使Domus卖得真好，There may be many other differences between Bowers and Domus.
* The feedback from the recent buyers may not be representative of all consumers.
* The fact that no complaint about small dining room has been received does not indicate that there will be no negative effects of decreasing the size of dining room at all. 
* The president fails to consider the possible cost of providing these features, thus we cannot ensure that our profits will certainly increase. 
* The fact that recent buyers did not complain does not indicate there will not be any dissatisfaction in the future.
* Merely Including the new features in new homes may not sufficiently ensure our sales and profits to increase. 房价太高人们买不起怎么办？

The following appeared in a letter from a firm providing investment advice for a client.

"Most homes in the northeastern United States, where winters are typically cold, have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating. Last heating season that region experienced 90 days with below-normal temperatures, and climate forecasters predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years. Furthermore, many new homes are being built in the region in response to recent population growth. Because of these trends, we predict an increased demand for heating oil and recommend investment in Consolidated Industries, one of whose major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* Furthermore, many new homes are being built in the region in response to recent population growth.


提纲：

* 假设一：既然Most homes in the northeastern United States传统用oil取暖，那么他们也一定会继续用oil取暖。Other new heating fuel may be available currently. 比如会不会有新的取暖方式。No evidence could guarantee that new homes in this region will continue to use heating oil as fuel for heating. 比如 油价波动会不会促使改变（比如中东石油危机导致汽车型号的改变）。电取暖，地热取暖，太阳能这些会不会改变取暖习惯？或者出色的墙体保温技术。
* Last heating season that region experienced 90 days with below-normal temperatures这个需要假设90天低于正常温度是一个较长的时间。如果一般多数年份是高于低温期温度的，那么就不一定必须取暖了。其次，climate forecasters的观点必须是真实，有效，可信的。但是长期预报是一个比较专业的领域，同时全球主流观点是变暖，这个就需要专家们给出更多的说明。
* The author does not provide any information about the actual amount of heating oil used due to the cold weather last year, thus we cannot evaluate the argument. 
* 人口增加不一定导致取暖需求增加。比如：新增人口租房住的比例很高；或者，他们属于短期工作，寒冷的冬季都会离开；或者即使新建了住宅但是采用了新的取暖技术。
* Granted that the demand for heating oil will increase, we cannot guarantee that investing in Consolidated Industries will be profitable. 这个其实要假设：居民使用燃油的效率不会提高，否则可以使用更少的燃油满足需求；其次这个公司没有激烈市场竞争，居民会买其产品；同时，该公式的管理可以有足够的竞争力而不是无法合理控制成本或者内部混乱。

The following appeared in a memo to the board of directors of a company that specializes in the delivery of heating oil.

"Most homes in the northeastern United States, where winters are typically cold, have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating. Last heating season, that region experienced 90 days with below-normal temperatures, and climate forecasters predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years. Furthermore, many new homes are being built in the region in response to recent population growth. Because of these trends, we can safely predict that this region will experience an increased demand for heating oil during the next five years."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

The following appeared in an article in the Grandview Beacon.

"For many years the city of Grandview has provided annual funding for the Grandview Symphony. Last year, however, private contributions to the symphony increased by 200 percent and attendance at the symphony's concerts-in-the-park series doubled. The symphony has also announced an increase in ticket prices for next year. Given such developments, some city commissioners argue that the symphony can now be fully self-supporting, and they recommend that funding for the symphony be eliminated from next year's budget."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

论点：the symphony can now be fully self-supporting, and  that funding for the symphony be eliminated from next year's budget.

论据：

* Last year, however, private contributions to the symphony increased by 200 percent and attendance at the symphony's concerts-in-the-park series doubled. 
* The symphony has also announced an increase in ticket prices for next year. 


提纲：

* We do not know the base amount of private contributions to the Symphony the year before last, thus we cannot evaluate if the contributions were significant. 
* The fact that attendance at the concert series doubled does not necessarily indicate that the Symphony is operating successfully. 比如原来上座率就很低。同时是不是所有的音乐会都收费呢？如果免费音乐会占很大的比例，那么其实增加也没什么。
* The facts cited by the planner, including the increased private contributions, popularity of concert series, may not recur in the following years. 比如经济下滑了等。
* The planner does not inform us how much will the ticket prices actually increase. 这只是计划加价，但是不确定万一不适合市场则无法确保收益。同时，无法确保万一运用成本上升怎么办？
* Eliminating the funding for the Symphony alone may not prevent a budget deficit sufficiently. Other measures could also be taken to prevent a budget deficit. 
* some city commissioners argue的计划还需要接受群众的讨论支持或者反对要等待大家讨论参与。毕竟公共预算需要公众支持。

The following appeared in a memo from a budget planner for the city of Grandview.

"Our citizens are well aware of the fact that while the Grandview Symphony Orchestra was struggling to succeed, our city government promised annual funding to help support its programs. Last year, however, private contributions to the symphony increased by 200 percent, and attendance at the symphony's concerts-in-the-park series doubled. The symphony has also announced an increase in ticket prices for next year. Such developments indicate that the symphony can now succeed without funding from city government and we can eliminate that expense from next year's budget. Therefore, we recommend that the city of Grandview eliminate its funding for the Grandview Symphony from next year's budget. By doing so, we can prevent a city budget deficit without threatening the success of the symphony."

The following appeared in a memo from a budget planner for the city of Grandview.

"When the Grandview Symphony was established ten years ago, the city of Grandview agreed to provide the symphony with annual funding until the symphony became self-sustaining. Two years ago, the symphony hired an internationally known conductor, who has been able to attract high-profile guest musicians to perform with the symphony. Since then, private contributions to the symphony have tripled and attendance at the symphony's outdoor summer concert series has reached record highs. Now that the symphony has succeeded in finding an audience, the city can eliminate its funding of the symphony."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

聘请的国际知名指挥家要价怎么样？如果很贵是不是会增加成本。其次，有名的指挥家不一定会招来有名的音乐家，对于音乐家这只是一个考虑因素。再其次，我们不知道这些音乐家是不是可以固定和Grandview Symphony合作。如果他们离开怎么办？

另外attendance at the symphony's outdoor summer concert series这是夏季的情况，冬季呢？这只是一个夏季系列的节目情况，我们需要更加全面的数据。

It is true that the symphony struggled financially for many years, but last year private contributions to the symphony increased by 200 percent and attendance at the symphony's concerts-in-the-park series doubled. In addition, the symphony has just announced an increase in ticket prices for next year. For these reasons, we recommend that the city eliminate funding for the Grandview Symphony Orchestra from next year's budget.

The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals.

"In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than did the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system.

论据：

* In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than did the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. 
* During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group.

提纲：

* The result of the laboratory study may not properly apply to normal hospital environment. 其次实验室环境使用的是concentrated solution of UltraClean，那么普通的药水和concentrated solution of UltraClean是一样的么？一般而言，浓度越大，杀伤力越强。最其次，实验室的计划实施我们需要知道其资质是不是有资格承担相应研究或者可以确保准确度。
* The director fails to inform us if the bacteria killed by UltraClean are all harmful.
* The success of UltraClean at the tested hospital, if there is any, does not necessarily recur at other hospitals. 比如workby这个医院是不是环境更好一点。或者workby病人本身身体素质更好一点,人口结构年轻，公共卫生好？workby当地的气候是不是宜人养病等等。或者workby医院的管理更好，护理水平更高？
* The director fails to differentiate between the severity of infections at the tested hospital, thus we cannot ensure that UltraClean  can effectively prevent serious infections.
* Granted that UltraClean  is very effective in killing bacteria, the director does not demonstrate the necessity of supplying UltraClean  at all our hospitals. 比如其他地方的人口结构，公共卫生状况，人们的饮食习惯，生活习惯，地理气候，以及对于洗手液的偏好都可能不同。不可盲目类比。
* The director overlooks other effective measures of preventing patient infections. 
* The director fails to consider if Nadasept has any side effect.

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily newspaper.

"Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth-league sports, over 40,000 of these young players suffered injuries. When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league soccer players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure exerted by coaches and parents to win games. Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities. Since the disadvantages outweigh any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

论点：Since the disadvantages outweigh any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine.

论据：

* Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth-league sports, over 40,000 of these young players suffered injuries. 
* When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league soccer players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure exerted by coaches and parents to win games. 
* Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities. 

提纲：

* The fact that many young players suffered injuries throughout the country does not necessarily indicate that Parkville should discontinue athletic competition. 
* Without the total number of children who participated in the competitions we could not evaluate the situation. 比如有800万小学生参与，那么其实4,000的受伤很低的比例。
* The author does not differentiate the severity of injuries. 如果只是擦伤，轻微扭伤其实不算什么。
* We need to know how about the injury-rate of those young players compared with children who do not participate in these games. 比如孩子如果不参加运动那么其实也会有受伤的可能性。We do not know the rate of injuries before children participated in these games, thus could not evaluate if the situation are getting worse.
* The players in the recent study might not be representative of all young players.  其次，这些小运动员会不会夸大他们的压力？再次，我们必须区分它们的压力不是学习压力，运动竞争压力引起的。最后，The young players at Parkville may not necessarily also suffer psychological pressure as the players do in those major cities.
* No information about the academic performance of the children who participated in youth-leagues is provided, thus we could not judge if we need to discontinue athletic competition to guarantee more academic activities for these students. 所以The author unfairly assumes that children would use the time for academic activities if they did not take part in those games.
* 其次这些专家的背景，专业技能，是不是没有任何利益关联，可以独立，客观是存疑的。
* The fact that many children were injured in  soccer games does not indicate that we should discontinue all other athletic competitions. 
* The author fails to consider the positive effects of athletic competition.同时也有很多不是太需要身体对抗的项目，比如排球，羽毛球，乒乓球是不是也会容易受伤呢？

Collectors prize the ancient life-size clay statues of human figures made on Kali Island but have long wondered how Kalinese artists were able to depict bodies with such realistic precision. Since archaeologists have recently discovered molds of human heads and hands on Kali, we can now conclude that the ancient Kalinese artists used molds of actual bodies, not sculpting tools and techniques, to create these statues. This discovery explains why Kalinese miniature statues were abstract and entirely different in style: molds could be used only for life-size sculptures. It also explains why few ancient Kalinese sculpting tools have been found. In light of this discovery, collectors predict that the life-size sculptures will decrease in value while the miniatures increase in value.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction.

提纲：

* The recently discovered molds of human heads and hands are not necessarily used by Kalinese artists for sculpting. 比如是另外的族群使用的，只是因为各种原因比如贸易等移动懂Kalinese.
* Granted those molds were used for sculpture purpose, we cannot hastily conclude that Kalinese artist also use molds to create all life-size statues.比如这些事提供仿真作用的呢？
* Other possible factors would also lead to the differences between miniature statues and life-size statures. 比如小雕像只是用来整体构图使用的草稿。
* Alternative explanation could also explain why few ancient Kalinese sculpting tools have been found.比如那些工具腐烂了。或者但是为了妥善保管工具，工具被专门存储在一个未被发现的地方。 其次，No sufficient evidence is provided to prove that Kalinese artists did not use any sculpting tools and techniques to create life-size statues. 
* The author’s assumption that the life-size sculptures will decrease in value and the miniatures to increase in value is unwarranted. 艺术品价值取决于稀缺程度和很多因素不能但从工艺技术的角度考虑。其次，部分collectors的观点是不是可以准确可信呢？我们需要更多地检验。

When Stanley Park first opened, it was the largest, most heavily used public park in town. It is still the largest park, but it is no longer heavily used. Video cameras mounted in the park's parking lots last month revealed the park's drop in popularity: the recordings showed an average of only 50 cars per day. In contrast, tiny Carlton Park in the heart of the business district is visited by more than 150 people on a typical weekday. An obvious difference is that Carlton Park, unlike Stanley Park, provides ample seating. Thus, if Stanley Park is ever to be as popular with our citizens as Carlton Park, the town will obviously need to provide more benches, thereby converting some of the unused open areas into spaces suitable for socializing.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

* An obvious difference is that Carlton Park, unlike Stanley Park, provides ample seating.

提纲： 

* The number of cars at the park’s parking lots may not be a good indication of the park’s popularity.因为可能很多人不开车去，或者开车去但是停在其他停车站。
* 其次数据比较不合适，S park使用的是上月平均，但是C park使用的工作日，也就是周一到周五，C处于商业区，一般而言工作人人流多，这对于S并不是很公平的比较。
* There may be some special reasons last month that resulted in the dropped popularity of Stanley Park. 比如：The author does not provide information concerning the number of visitors at Stanley before the cameras were mounted. 是不是人们考虑隐私问题不去？
* Many other differences may render the two parks not comparable. 比如一个是绿地公园供人们休息的；一个是主题乐园可以餐饮娱乐的。或者两个公园的地理位置不同，周围居民的工作性质，生活水平不同。The author fails to convince us that it is the ample seating that makes Carlton so popular. 
* The author fails to consider the possible negative effects of converting unused open areas into public social spaces 或者增加座椅。比如本来人们就喜欢S的空旷空间，加上椅子反而累赘。

The following appeared in a memo from the owner of a chain of cheese stores located throughout the United States.

"For many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of both domestic and imported cheeses. Last year, however, all of the five best-selling cheeses at our newest store were domestic cheddar cheeses from Wisconsin. Furthermore, a recent survey by Cheeses of the World magazine indicates an increasing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers. Since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory, the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

The situation at the newest store might not be representative of all stores. (selective sample/C.S) ★★★★
The president does not provide any information about the subscribers of Cheese of the World, thus they may not be representative of United States consumers. (are the respondents representative?) ★★★★
Many other better ways might be available to improve profits of our stores. (necessity of the solution) ★★★
The president fails to consider the negative effects of discontinuing the inventory of imported cheeses. (adv:disadv) ★★★★
The president does not provide any information about the actual profit of domestic and imported cheese respectively, thus we cannot evaluate the president’s conclusion.
